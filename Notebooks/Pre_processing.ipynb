       " 'the much awaited shangi chi and the legend of the ten rings released today in theatres  it follows the journey of shang chi  simu liu   the son of the famed mcu villain the mandarin  who revolts against his father to fight evil   the first stand alone film featuring an asian american superhero  shang chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences  all the actors and especially simu liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows  with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in san francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in macau  the standouts   awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the mcu provide genuine  sarcasm laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience  cameos from benedict wong and ronnie chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits    without stooping to cultural appropriation  with an all asian crew  director destin daniel cretton pays rich tribute to chinese heritage at every turn  hong kong’s superstars tony leung and michelle yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don’t seem to have lost a step with age  acing their action sequences  shows their dedication as performers   regarded as one of the finest actor s chinese cinema has every produced  tony leung stamps his class all over the film  giving an engrossing  captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the ten rings  his inner moral dilemmas and love hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed ‘small tiger’ among the five tiger generals of hong kong cinema   the flashback sequences help to build up shang chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac  and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father’s murderous tendencies  as his son  he is inadvertently drawn to the mandarin’s world of violence and carnage   the films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise laden post credit sequences tie into both doctor strange’s world of mystic arts as well as a possible connection that the ten rings has to alien technology  as always  the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its phases is a joy in itself   it is due to the well written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that shang chi stands out while the eye catching cgi and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product    another wonderful new addition to the mcu world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on   highly recommended  a must watch  marvel s phase   continues to raise the bar',\n",
       " 'like many  i was concerned that this new marvel cinematic universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but shang chi has already left me hopeful for the series’ future  i literally know nothing about this character but i found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure  well acted  effectively character driven  occasionally funny  rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action  it has what i hoped i was going to get from black panther  inclusivity and an interesting world and narrative  i’m    all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced  too and i just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating   although shang chi treads the familiar origin story formula  there’s a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character’s journey apart from the others  though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast paced yet slightly derivative set pieces in urban environments  the second half is where the film really turns on  at least for me   the chinese philosophy kicks in  the mythology is abundant  there’s tons of visually striking imagery  a fantastical setting  loads of insane action choreography  the asian representation is just off the chain and i was so enraptured by it  it doesn’t feel contrived  i sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding  a nice balance  i was very satisfied with what i saw  i’m really looking forward to seeing more of shang chi’s world and how it’ll tie in with other stories yet to come  very cool movie  soulful  cultural and action packed',\n",
       " 'no movie is without flaws  but this was a breath of fresh air for the mcu  some of my favorite movies now are one offs like black panther or antman  which have so little ties to the other films that you can enjoy them without spending money on all the other movies to try to understand where you are in the overall storyline   going into this  i was worried that it would be a very western type of plot line to portray eastern lore  but i was pleasantly surprised  the amount of action was indicative of marvel’s style and was certainly overdone at the beginning  where the plot could have moved on a little quicker  but there were also moments where you were just allowed to breathe   they spent time showing character interactions that made people’s bonds with one another believable and made me care for them  awkwafina’s character katy had almost none of marvel’s standard comic relief character flaws and instead had mostly delightful interactions with shang  there were gorgeous slowed down scenes that showed the more peaceful flow of movement of the ta lo people  and lastly the story was not told linearly but instead cyclically with constant breaks back into flashbacks  i was extremely impressed by this less formulaic method of storytelling   spoilers    one flaw  the instigator for the conflict is a situation where the father is able to be tricked by a mere voice  and that is not completely believable because he has lived for over a thousand years and would have to be smarter than that to have lasted this long  his grief at the loss of his wife would have been more convincing as a motivator for his lack of critical thinking if it had been more recent    i won’t go into too many others  over all  this is a very solid movie  it might not be everyone’s cup of tea  but at least for me  as someone who likes eastern media for its focus on character interactions  familial friend love  cyclical story telling  and often its focus on complex solutions to problems  this was a nice homage to that',\n",
       " 'hands down one of the best mcu movies  every actor actress were believable and the fighting choreography was extremely well choreographed and executed  i also really love that it wasn t a normal marvel movie with all the jokes  it felt more real in terms of dialogue   the fighting as well wasn t anything crazy like you d see in a lot of kung fu movies  this was more like your classic jackie chan stunts  where it s able to be done as a regular human being  obviously that s been training   what i mean by this is  there was no superpowers involved for the martial arts  like no flying  fighting in the air  being able to jump   feet in the air  etc  only time there was anything extraordinary was when the ten rings was being wielded or  someone  with actual powers as a guardian   although the movie being a little over   hours  you don t feel like it s a drag nor does it feel rushed either  if you ve never read any comics on shang chi  like myself   this film really goes over who he is and his past as well as his father  it doesn t feel forced and doesn t feel like they left anything out either   i know awkwafina tends to play as the same type of jokester sisterly best friend character in many of the films she acts in  but her character definitely suited her really well   i ll definitely be watching this again with some friends  highly recommend',\n",

       " 'i d be remiss if i talk about this film s brilliant performance  from the beginning  the storyline was grounded and had intentional stunts and visual effects  not a lot to deviate from the storytelling and not a little that one wouldn t notice  this is the kind of integration that is very much deserving of a marvel film  i am biased on the extensive vfx crew as they portrayed creatures  environments  animations  and simulations that felt true to life and served to tell a story without it being distracting  we have truly come a long way  here s to waiting for eternals',\n",

       " 'warning  some spoiler alerts       hm i suppose it was an alright movie but definitely not one of marvel’s best and personally i thought black widow was better  the script was pretty poor as was the plot and especially the character development  i found myself bored a few times throughout the movie as the pacing was a bit off  i’m not sure if it was too fast or too slow or maybe alternating between both without finding a good pace  the flashbacks of which there were quite a bit were kind of awkwardly placed as they explained a scene from immediately before or immediately after which i believe messed with the plot a little   when one of the characters die towards the end it didn’t feel nearly as meaningful as it should have been  i’m not sure how i can explain why but it wasn’t moving to me when it likely should have been  i felt the death of a side character  the bow and arrow instructor guang bo  more  but perhaps that is just me     continuing on  some things were kind of left unexplained or with too little detail to make it meaningful like the appearance of the little “chicken pig ” the dragon “great protector ” and the “dweller in darkness ” who turns out to be the big evil final boss or however you want to put it   i also found it kind of idiotic that the main characters shang chi  katie  and xialing  were in incredible disbelief about the existence of magic and an alternate dimension where their own mother came from  especially after witnessing wong from dr  strange open portals etc  overall the film had a certain lackluster and i’d probably blame it on the director more than anything else as the actors did what they could    on the plus side the fight scenes were really cool as were the scenes when they finally arrive to ta lo where shang chi’s mother is from    it was an ok movie and could have been done a lot better  would i watch it again  probably not  but i don’t necessarily regret watching it',\n",
       " 'eh  the entire plot was super predictable  and it was definitely aimed at a younger audience  most of the jokes weren t funny  and shang chi s friend was just there for comic relief  that s it  she was completely useless except for the moment she turned into legolas and got insanely good at the bow and arrow with   minutes of practice  also  i didn t think i would see anyone riding a dragon in a marvel movie  it was soooo out of place  this movie actually reminded me of raya and the last dragon  shang chi should have been the live action mulan we were all waiting for  not a marvel movie  however  the cgi was good  as always  and the fight scenes were well choreographed  it also had some end credit scenes that are important to the future of mcu s phase    so definitely worth watching  black widow was a much better movie overall  although that wasn t a perfect film either  shang chi got     stars in my opinion  don t trust rotten tomatoes',\n",
       " 'out of    really great overall  the fight choreography was seriously well thought out and done  the story while being a bit formulaic in some areas is much better than most mcu films  the cast all did well especially tony leung  this really feels like a throwback to old kung fu adventure films but given the big budget marvel treatment made by people who truly understand the source material and a director who was clearly passionate about the project as well as it’s lead',\n",

       " 'the movie started out good with the early fighting sequences standing out  i think casting was great and character development moves at a decent pace during the first half of the movie  however  the story moves quite slowly and it loses its momentum in the second half  the fantastic elements that begin to pop up feel a bit in your face and get more attention that they deserve  the final arc was kind of underwhelming and anticlimactic both in its action and in wrapping up the story  the excessive nods to chinese culture elements become unnecessarily stereotypical and the final battle feels more like a mashup of “mulan” and “how to train your dragon” than a mcu movie  in the end  the characters are salvageable  even though at times it felt as if the story was more about tony leung’s character than shang chi himself  i just hope marvel finds a better way to incorporate him and its lore into the mcu where it doesn’t feel forced  like they did with captain marvel',\n",

       " 'this film messed me up  asian american experience all through out this film  the throw back to jackie chan films  hidden dragon crouching tiger  and even a damn kaiju fight  like bruh it was super asian  i loved that  i like what simu liu said  pride where there was once shame  and tbh those films were awesome but it also brought a lot of ridicule from people around us  those films were the ones that were referenced when growing up in the states  i loved the distant father  because we asians really do connect with the mom more  and only when we grow up do we really feel a sense of regret from the father  that he was emotionally distant  and this film captured that as well',\n",

       " 'i m a big fan of the mcu  this movie is a step in the direction of cast introduction and character building  marvel has opened the door for  yet another  sequel rich franchise  the script was in need of some trimming to sew it up better  with a few scenes long in duration    the action scenes were technically exciting and vivid while viewed immersed in an amc dolby cinema theater  the dolby sound was sweet science to my ears    overall  it s sure to drive up the stock in amc and marvel',\n",
       " 'i liked it  i really did  but i m not sure why everyone in the world is flipping out on how great it is  really good martial arts fantasy    awkwafina and liu are just fantastic  she needs more leading roles  one of those actresses that when she s on the screen  you re completely focused on her  chemistry and humor between her and liu was great   plot was good  effects good  action scenes  superb  but if it weren t for a few mcu references and cameos  this could have been a mainstream kung fu fantasy film outside the mcu',\n",

       " 'really loved it  we saw it in real   which  we thought  enhanced the epic cg special fx  the dragon fight kept me on the edge of my seat  and the choreography of the martial arts confrontations was like watching a beautiful dance  you ll get a kick out of  morris    and try to pick out ben kingsley  definitely a must see if you like great action',\n",

       " 'three words  save your money   the character with the liverpool accent was the best character in the movie and was really funny and he was unique  awkwfina had some funny parts  unfortunately most of her jokes weren’t that funny  you could probably tell that this movie was aimed to a younger audience generation   the childhood flashbacks that shung chi had were so much  which made the movie a slow pace one  i felt bored halfway through the movie and i daydreamed about my dinner instead of focusing on the plot  also  some of the scenes almost felt as if they were repetitive  for example  shung chi fights against his father’s army and then they make up and work together  shung chi has a brief flashback and then another fight against his father’s army commence and they make up and then he has some flashbacks of his childhood    some parts of the movie were cringe and the dragons at the end of the movie were so awkward and thr movie failed to explain the reason behind the appearance of the dragons    the father being the villan also was out of place',\n",
       " 'well the movie was predictable   they showed all the important scenes in the trailer itself like the final battle against wen wo and the dragon appearing   the cgi or vfx was good well it was fantastic but at last i give it a     because of great acting and voice acting in hindi dub  it was a great origin story for the shang chi  the fight coriography was amazing especially the fight at shang chi s sister place  final review a good film',\n",

       " 'the movie is mesmerising   from the graphics to exceptional cast to all those insane fighting scenes  the amount of efforts and time the whole team gave can be seen  watch and loved every bit of it  its fun  adventurous  full of action and kumg fu  simply perfect   what a intro for asian marvel movie   😭♥️♥️',\n",
       " 'this is the best mcu origin story ever  the movie is full of emotions and display topics of family  love  change  etc very well  the acting and chemistry between all the actors actresses were amazing  the movie was entertaining throughout  shang chi will clearly plan a huge part in the phase   of the mcu  a must watch',\n",
       " 'i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys both action films and social equality  this should be the way for a decade ago  thanks that this first asian american led marvel movie is made happened  meanwhile  do appreciate the chinese culture though is not much haha  thank you for reading my review',\n",
       " 'i thought it was exceptionally well done  the acting  the direction  the visuals  and the story  the story incorporated chinese myth and legend  and yet stayed true to the mcu  it was not fully true to the comic books  but the storyline was even better  it actually was a long way from some martial arts film ripoff  although that was part of the story  i think people will be looking forward to the next shang chi film',\n",
       " 'thank marvel for having leung chui wai in this movie  i find myself always fall into his eyes any time i see him in a movie  he has a pair of eyes full of sadness  or say emotions that make people want to protect and love him  this is just a background movie for shang chi  but a totally love tragedy for leung  you can enjoy tony in suits  white shirt or chinese traditional clothes  and definitely  his mandarin with a little accent',\n",
       " 'walking out of the theater thinking to myself how does marvel continue to get better  this movie was phenomenal  strong storytelling  perfect fight scenes  and the way marvel implemented culture into this film  i recommend this movie to everyone even if you aren’t a marvel fan  great job',\n",
       " 'as a marvel fan i’m disappointed it barely attached itself to the rest of the mcu and didn’t answer and of the questions marvel lovers have been waiting way too long for  but i did love this movie  cast was perfect  action was amazing  story telling was amazing  lore building was amazing  music was amazing  i’m thoroughly impressed and i loved it   it also made me excited for what they’ll bring to the mcu regarding asian culture and i’m now more excited that atlantis is supposed to get a south american reimagining',\n",
       " 'this movie is amazing  i watched it yesterday         at a regal cinema in elk grove with my dad and my brother  i would definitely watch this movie again and i would recommend it to all of my friends  my favorite part was the very last scene after the credits when shang chi said   we could sleep orrrrrrr     and the shang chi  katy  and wong start singing  hotel california',\n",
       " 'spectacular     i don t even like super hero movies  i went because my daughter wanted to go  i will see it again and i m hoping for a follow up  i think this was visually stunning and the chinese culture added heart to the story  the cast was amazing and it was great to finally see their culture showcased in such a beautiful way on the big screen',\n",
       " 'loved the movie  saw it in imax    tony leung stole the spotlight when he s shown on screen as the mandalorian  the rest of the cast is epic   if you re a fan of stephen chow s movies such as   kung fu hustle  nor  shaolin soccer  there s familiar actors in there that has worked with chow s  these are all great actors  familiar and new  i recon everyone to go see it',\n",
       " 'amazing    at first my hype wasn t high for this film  but as the first   trailers dropped  my hype was out the roof  the action definitely did not disappoint and it is one of my favourite marvel films ever  definitely would recommend and loved that final fight',\n",
       " 'i am from china  and i don t like this movie  i love this movie    shang chi is a pretty fantastic movie that shows a coherent and fascinating story in which many characters speak authentic chinese and show the cultural pride itself  i know many people in china hate this movie  i totally understand because they are so annoyed that asian americans can be one part of the mainstream and live in their own culture with confidence',\n",
       " 'of all the kung fu movies i seen  this new marvel comic book movie did it again only better  i seen this movie twice in theaters and for what i love this one  the fast fighting scenes took me by surprise   most of all i like to give extra credit to simu for giving us the best performance as shang chi  awkwafina for always being funny   did heroic stuff in this movie and finally tony for playing the greatest main villain in this movie i ever seen',\n",
       " 'shang chi hit so hard man  it was a great combination of chinese mythological background with blockbuster fight scenes  marvel is working on really great projects  hats off for producing such an awesome asian dominated movie  showing badass girl power at the mid credits and so on',\n",
       " 'absolutely stunning  one of the best mcu movies to date and top   greatest comicbook movie of all time  shang chi is amazing  best superhero action in a very long time and lots of depth and great storytelling that really separate this from other superhero movies  easily the best comicbook movie of the year so far',\n",
       " 'awesome view into a different marvel world  action was spot on and the story telling kept you enthralled  its message of nature vs nurture and finding ones purpose was great  a must watch  i will be seeing this movie again',\n",
       " 'it is really hard to please me with films  i ll usually point out every single flaw  but shang chi kept me engrossed for the entire length of the film   i genuinely couldn t look away  amazing  emotional fight scenes  thrilling action scenes  and an awesome journey for a new hero',\n",
       " 'best marvel s solo film  visually stunning in camerarip itself that means in theatre   best music   editing   different screenplay  nice story   humor is expressed by katy character  direction and story is fantastic  flashbacks are clear enough which is not in black widow movie and finally more fantastic than expected had lots of fun  one sadness in my mind is not watched this movie in theatres but go to theatres worth of it   thank you',\n",
       " 'one of the best marvel movies till now  it s packed with cool action scenes and ties up well into the mcu  has a good story  character played perfectly  and much better than black widow  i highly recommend you watch it',\n",
       " 'shang chi  absolute joy and entertainment from start to finish  great fight scenes in the bus  scaffolding and moving vehicles  the last fight scenes were not to be missed too  be sure to stay until the last credits to roll  you will find more footage there too  well worth the watch  great characters  even the british actor and morrison   shangchi',\n",
       " 'this movie was decent as a marvel fan after what came before this  titles like endgame infinity war its leaves your expectations very high they really dropped the bar on this movie and i can understand it because its a new character and we have to know the backstory etc  but the action didn t make up for the drag of the slow sentimental story telling  as well as non important flashbacks that i felt was not needed  do not go see this movie late at night it will not keep you up…',\n",
       " 'one of my favorite marvel movies  great martial arts combat sequences  fantastic visuals  and i enjoyed the character development  it wasn t perfect  but the next phase of mcu should be fine  my main issue is awkwafina s somewhat forced  funny  persona   felt like she tried too hard and was rigid in her delivery  she s not on youtube anymore',\n",
       " 'the action and fight scene is superb  the bestie chemistry between shang chi and katy was really good  they can be a good couple if ever  overall is great  what a nice movie   i didn t expect it to be that great    i love it so much  i hope it has a sequel',\n",
       " 'i just finished watching the movie oh my god this was amazing the pacing and action was perfect  also the humor was perfect and spot on  i defenilty recommend this movie  they perfectly introduced shang chi into the marvel universe we know and love and they did it so good  and now for some reason i wanna learn karate or something like that but besides that i m definitely getting some merch it was so good and the suits were cool too  so go watch shang chi and the legend of the ten rings i promise its worth the wait',\n",
       " 'just loved it  action was top class vfx was undeniably the best of mcu till now  and the emotions were up to the point and the humor was clicked at the right time  visually it was very soothing  unfortunately no   shows are available in india  but if you truly want to enjoy it go to the theaters asap  thank me later😉😉',\n",
       " 'okay  so if you are deciding to watch this movie shang   chi and legend of   rings  then i will really recommend this movie  full action  adventure  suspense and much more  i rate it   stars because it is amazing   must watch and you will never reget that your whole life  enjoy 😊',\n",
       " 'wow wow wow i mean i knew since it s marvel that it s gunna be a good movie but whoa  this movie is amazing  everything is just amazing  the fights  the comedy  just saw it and i honestly want to go see it again  i ll admit i thought marvel hit it s high with avengers     but nope it hasn t  i really hope they keep making movies like this',\n",
       " 'i honestly wasn t expecting much from this film but having watched it  i loved it more than i thought i would   they bring such a rich culture into this movie   there is a whole different world that needs to be discovered   really glad to have an asian superhero within marvel',\n",
       " 'i didn t really care for the story of this movie  i almost never check my watch during a movie but this one had me glancing a few times wondering how much longer the movie was going to take  it just felt too drawn out and in all honesty the story itself wasn t that interesting to me  also  the humor was very hit or miss  some jokes had me laughing hard  while others really just had me rolling my eyes hoping the movie would end   finally  for a franchise that has been ramping up it s politically driven content  what really disappointed me is that this a movie specifically revolving around china s heritage  culture  and history  yet it tries to raise american social and political issues rather than to discuss chinese political and social issues    pros  fight sequences were nicely choreographed  visual effects were pleasant to watch  the soundtrack  in some scenes  were absolute bangers    cons  pacing of story all over the place  the actual story  to me  just wasn t interesting  or maybe the way it was executed just was weak   the acting was    something to expect from a mid tier movie at best  the incessant jokes  somehow  it lacked originality  felt like any other kung fu movie    overall  it was fine  not a movie i will watch again by any means  but there are definitely worse marvel movies  i d rate this a b tier movie at best',\n",
       " 'marvel is so amazing for making this movie  they are complete geniuses  the first ever marvel kung fu movie and they completely nailed it  i love the acting i love aquafina as katie everything was just spot on and it made me a lot more excited for the films to come',\n",
       " 'i am not a huge fan of superhero type movies  because of how predictable they are  however  this movie stands out and i highly recommend it  the plot flows so nicely and it is not cliche like many other movies i’ve seen    stars for sure  lots of action too  and humor',\n",
       " 'wow i was pleasantly surprised this was a great movie all the way around  however i could have simplified it to be about   minutes long  here goes   dad calls kids on conference call   dad    hey kids i needs a favor  can i barrow your green pendants for something important   kids   sure dad  do you want us to over night them or would you like us to stop by   dad   either one  thanks   the end',\n",
       " 'i like it very much  it presents chinese culture from someone outside the mainland  which is amazing to me  i sincerely believe there are many ways to interpret chinese culture and no one should be deemed as authentic while declaring others  mis interpreted   i believe the movie did it in its own way  great',\n",
       " 'first the good  there are some nice fighting scenes  i liked awkwafina  but there is so much more bad than good  for example  to go to an ancient hidden village  you need a car and drive at right angles  why does xu wenwu continue to attack the wall  when he should see the demons coming out  why does xu xialing take over the terrorist organisation of her hated father  not the worst movie in the mcu  but close',\n",
       " 'not bad  but i felt like it was missing something  i think it could use a little less climactic monster fighting and more character moments  especially between the father and his two kids  the sister was just kind of there for most of the scenes and felt a bit wasted  i think this one could use a little more soul and little less action  that’s what makes marvel great  the characters and the story  not the special effects and grandiose action sequences  again  not bad  but  i’d skip it if you’re looking for a good stand alone movie  it really only worked for me because of the tie ins with the mcu as a whole and the potential future stories',\n",
       " 'great cgi  great plot  amazing backstory and character development  only weakness was that some scenes felt rushed and i wish the transition between events would ve been a bit smoother  other than that fantastic movie  must watch on the big screen  definitely going into my top',\n",
       " 'not sure why so much hype  watched and my feeling was  meh     just becasue disney have money they can take any risk now  the story is written from atla  zuko alone and his ark and aang s airbending   snakeeye  this another overrated movie after gotg    captain marvel and dc s suicide squad  bunch of meaningless cameos and the comedy girl who thinks she is funny  visuals are good in standard  somewhat ok bgm  totally meaningless screenplay  wait for it to be available for free on tv or disney',\n",
       " 'i really enjoyed this movie   vfx were spectacular    fight scenes were very cool   loved the asian themed storyline and characters   about time   awkwafina was  for me  questionable at the beginning but she offered the usual marvel doses of humor   all in all i thought it was great',\n",
       " 'i saw this in harkins theater  and i liked it  i did already know that this movie was gonna be worth watching  and enjoying  for sure it was  the storyline was great  the action was good  but other than that  i give shang chi a solid five stars across the board  one of the best marvel movies made',\n",
       " 'this movie does nothing to explain the ten rings of iron man legend  from that standpoint the movie was terrible  as a stand alone kung fu movie  it still wasn t great  nothing new in choreography  and martial arts movies still have a lot to learn about showing degrees of abilities  the only movie to get this right was crouching tiger hidden dragon  i will say lots of easter eggs and homage to other marvel movies  if that s your jam run out and see this movie  if not wait for it to hit disney plus  i give this movie     stars out of five',\n",
       " 'this was an incredible movie  with amazing choreography and story  the characters are well developed  and the martial arts gives the fight scenes an extra glamor  the representation of chinese culture and religion was done extremely well  tying in to the story beautifully  i highly recommend seeing it',\n",
       " 'star for their hardwork  of the character who make me do it for them not for the movie story   i thought  this movie will be the best of the marvel but they have only tried but not succed to apply perfectly  this movie actually fails in a good movie list becase the script was not great  it was something like a fun kinds of movie but not as a action type  they try to take the movie in a magical world but this also take them backward as i have watched it so  i m saying these too  the introduction is confusing   at the middle the movie run so great but again at the ending  the movie is bad than the black widow   there s action scene better than black widow but the putting useless chracter at the end of the movie makes it too bad     you will see it as bad movie list of marvel after you watched the movie   yeah  i m dc fan  i m proud to be it not like you marvel kids who only watches movie for the joke    time to rise in content not in box office  restorethesnyderverse for my dceu  dc is better than marvel studio',\n",
       " 'it was a really good movie  i really liked it very action packed and better than i thought it would be  i still think that black widow was better  this movie kind of reminded me of frozen    with how his dad thought he heard his wife s voice  in frozen   how elsa heard the music  still a really great movie but only gonna get   stars for me',\n",
       " 'this is the kinda film that beats the lockdown blues  perfect film to watch on a big screen  excellent gorgeous visuals with plenty of action  a bit too much though    hands down the best origin movie from marvel  the postcredits scene is good too',\n",
       " 'definitely worth seeing  marvel sure has the formula to keep pushing out great movies even when it switches up the style like this one  it had it all  great story  non stop action  humor  and emotion  a must see for this year',\n",
       " 'i saw this movie on       and it is so different from any other marvel movie  but it was just as good  the fighting scenes were amazing  the story is very well told and the end fight scene is awesome  also  the mid credit scene had me so excited',\n",
       " 'so with the terrible introduction of the mandarin in iron man that was total bs… now this    instead of straightening out the origin and the  bad asseness of the mandarin…let’s jump to his son    doesn’t matter how awesome your special effects are or your fight choreography is…if your characters history has been completely altered by writers and directors who are continually trying to reinvent the wheel… you lose audiences    what is wrong with you hollywood  maybe you should stop being a puppet to the big red winnie the pooh followers  back to basics and being original',\n",
       " 'just watched shang chi legend of the ten rings  nothing much to say except that the movie was phenomenal  great action  humor  and characters villains  actors fitted the characters well  the plot was sophisticated but still simple and fresh      would recommend  definitely go watch',\n",
       " 'loved that a good    of it was in chinese to keep the movie s authenticity  the storyline i felt was a little typical  centering around the flaws of family and rebellion i think marvel nailed the interpretation of asian representation and i liked the neat touches on tradition and culture  i would give this one a      purely because i am not a big fan of marvel movies   interstellar is a     for reference',\n",
       " 'this was a good watch  nothing spectacular    it won t be all that memorable but i m not pissed that i left my house to watch this  most of the cast executed their parts well too  not to hate but awkwafina s character wasn t necessary and her arc was very very predictable finally  the mid credit scene was a fun part',\n",
       " 'amazing movie  fighting scenes were amazing with such great movements and beautiful actions  there were funny parts which made the movie not so tense and added a little bit of humor  we had culture in this movie  and different languages  i was not disappointed if u did not like this movie then do better',\n",
       " 'this was a great movie  very well done  i’m a fan of classic asian cinema  and i completely agree with all the other great reviews in terms of the acting  fighting sequences  cgi and other effects  i think that the film represented aspects of chinese culture respectfully  looking forward to the next one',\n",
       " 'it was absolutely amazing from start to end and had me hooked the entire time  simu liu and the entire cast did a phenomenal job playing their characters  and a  for the wonderful representation    everything in this movie was      from the plot to the visuals to the casting  and so on  i definitely recommend it',\n",
       " 'the begging was hilarious hands down and i loved the chemistry and representation  i wish they would have made it pg   instead of pg   because so it could be more realistic but at least their were more magic but the reason why i gave it three stars it i had a little higher expectations  but i don’t regret watching every single second',\n",
       " 'coming from an asian american who has watched chinese and american movies for    years  this is seriously one of the best  it captured feels of american films  retro hong kong film  chinese kung fu  chinese drama  plus marvel magic  loved it  a classic for ages to come',\n",
       " 'nothing new here  katy is quite honest  the bus scene is so boring it doesn t make any sense compared to nobody  it s soo far better than this  it s not the asian black panther  as much fun as the fights are they can t match the gasp or wince inducing wallop of jackie chan fight scenes  in which you know the star and stunt performers really are leaping around a moving vehicle or the side of a building  there are moments where characters are just chatting in a field and the field clearly isn t real',\n",
       " 'funny movie   good characters   good end of movie teasers that leave you wanting more info in marvel fashion  the story is great and has a decidedly strong asian influence that will play well with the mcu   the final battle scene is dynamic and frankly beautiful',\n",
       " 'i watched this yesterday and it was so good  i loved this marvel movie  it was hilarious at many places and sometimes you just wanted to drop a tear  great movie  i watched it in   so the quality at some places were horrible  i m not sure if it looks any better in the   version  but it was great  i reccomend you to watch the movie at a cinema  it just gives you butterflies',\n",
       " 'i loved this movie  i broke my covid   movie fast with this and wasn t disappointed  much respect to a wonderful new super hero  to tony leung who is still a bad    at   years old who really brought it   and michelle yeoh   looking forward to future movies',\n",
       " 'the movie was really nice  the acting by actors was on another level  simu liu was the least experienced actor but proved that how dynamic actor he is  awkafina amd tony leung played their part well  the comedy of awkafina was one of the best thing  tony leung proved that he is one of the best actor  all the facial expression was really nice  tony leung played the villian well  fala chan role was the emotional part of the movie  her role was nice for emotional touch  michelle yeoh played her part well  meng  er zhang played the role of xialing well  she was the most unpredictable character of the movie  the action  comedy  cgi  use of martial arts  mystical animals  a whole new magical place made the movie complete  the mid credits and post credits scene was an important part for making this a part of mcu  the only flaw was that we can tell that ta lo was being made through green screen  this can be improved  and marvel please don t add so many promotional vedios',\n",
       " 'this is a go to instant kung fu classic  so good  as far as it s ranking in the mcu  i don t think it s as good as ragnarok  but it s better than winter soldier  which means it s pretty f n good  had a blast watching it  oh  there s   end credit scenes  so stick around at the end',\n",

       " 'shang chi had its moments and was certainly beautiful  the cast was solid and the guys behind the camera have strong history  at the end though  i was left wanting in a way i have not been by an mcu film  maybe i shouldn t have watched all those shorts on youtube  i don t know  i was expecting dr  strange or best case black panther  what i got was a film that tried too hard to do too much  the plot was derivative and the story was mushy  the editors made suspect choices  laughs were in the wrong spots and it dragged in places  nobody bats a thousand  feige has come close  i m probably the victim of my own expectations here  i m not sure i ll even go to eternals   i m a sucker though  i ll probably pay up  it s may be my last if i walk out wishing i hadn t spent the money',\n",

       " 'awesome  everything is executed perfectly  fighting is just amazing  characters are good  classic mcu humor but still have serious tones  storyline is very interesting  i will def read shang chi s comics now',\n",
       " 'just a non canon mcu character   it seems as if the director of crazy rich asians is trying to ensure an asian spotlight  it has failed  the movie is equal to   ronin  which keanu was called a heritage taker  this is a small strike at the grasp of making it  i recommend he sticks to kim s convenience in canada',\n",

       " 'the fight scene is so amazing not too many over playing music every single time he s one of those marvel characters that forgives but with a reason not just to forgive to look good and the story had plot it didn t just jump from one scene it to another and expect you to look it up to find out what it meant later they jump from one scene but go back to the same scene so it can make sense',\n",

       " 'the movie does well to center on the main character s origin  with subtle traces of how it contributes to the mcu generally  the martial arts choreography was off the hook  the movie never lost its pace  it does well to keep you hooked throughout  and seeing shang in action makes me think the guy may be more powerful than we all thought   i mean immortality',\n",

       " 'this was unfortunately a pretty uninspired  boring and a needlessly long movie that is abusing the flasback system and is almost entirely made of exposition once someone interesting shows up the focus is changed back to the main characters making you wonder why they would tease us with a interesting persona and then never show them again   the comedy was pretty bad to be honest and it should have focused more on the comic relief than at the characters trying to make jokes  the only positive thing that i can tell about this movie that the small amount of fights were pretty great and badass   especially the bus scene music is forgetful and the acting was awkward and not that fine',\n",
       " 'this movie holds up incredibly well in the pantheon of mcu movies  but it has more soul than i experienced watching even black panther  it s pure poetry  art  ballet and martial arts lovingly and delicately massaged into a story about family and friendship  loss and grief',\n",
