       "[\"Shang-chi review : spectacular visual wonder\\nMy rating : 4/5\\nCast & performances : \\nThe film has Simu Liu in top form. He is your ordinary guy but extraordinary powers and actor blends into the character well - with not a single false note. Giving him good company are actresses Awkwafina who is effortless in whatever she does and Meng'er Zhang who also performs some mind-numbing stunts. \\nThe star of the film of course is veteran actor Tony Leung- a father who wants to bring back his family together but also is aware of his extraordinary powers. It's his love for his dead wife that makes him tough and cold towards his children. Years back Leung had charmed the world with his subtle style in Wong Kar Wai's 'In The Mood For Love'. Decades later, Leung has aged like fine wine and it's a delight to watch him play the antagonist with such style. \\nBen Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh too make their presence felt in the limited screen time they have. \\n\\nTechnical values : \\nShang-Chi scores high on its technical front. Each and every craft excels in giving a thoroughly enjoyable superhero action flick. The top-class VFX take the audience into a world of mythical adventure. The cinematography, production design and background score are top-notch.\\nShang-Chi, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, attempts to shake up the Marvel formula by infusing it with martial-arts action and fairy-tale fantasy and grounding it in Chinese and Asian American culture. And while its disparate elements don’t meld together as smoothly as they should, they do, in the end, add up to a superhero movie fresh and fun enough to feel worth a spin”.\\nShang Chi's strength lies in balancing itself. For every high octane action sequence, there's a back story to get you readjusted to your seat. The amazingly choreographed fights will bring you to the edge of your seats and at the same time, you can't help but groove to the peppy background score. There are so many good songs on their list. \\nApart from music, Marvel once again excels in terms of CGI. The graphics are so compelling that you don't regret stepping inside a cinema hall in times of a pandemic. They're worth it. \\n\\nHighlights : \\nCast & Brilliant performances\\nStunning top notch visual effects\\nExtraordinary High Octane Action Stunts\\nFantastic Cinematography\\nTerrific Background Score\\nGood story and Direction\\n\\nOverall : Adventurous ride into a mythical world.\",\n",
       " \"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.\\n\\nThe first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.\\n\\nAwkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits. \\n\\nWithout stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong’s superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don’t seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.\\n\\nRegarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings. His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed ‘Small Tiger’ among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong Cinema \\n\\nThe flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father’s murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin’s world of violence and carnage.\\n\\nThe films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange’s world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology. As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.\\n\\nIt is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product. \\n\\nAnother wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.\\n\\nHighly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!\",\n",
       " 'Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series’ future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I’m 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.\\n\\nAlthough Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there’s a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character’s journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there’s tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn’t feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I’m really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi’s world and how it’ll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie. Soulful, cultural and action-packed.',\n",
       " 'No movie is without flaws, but this was a breath of fresh air for the MCU. Some of my favorite movies now are one-offs like Black Panther or Antman, which have so little ties to the other films that you can enjoy them without spending money on all the other movies to try to understand where you are in the overall storyline.\\n\\nGoing into this, I was worried that it would be a very Western type of plot-line to portray Eastern lore, but I was pleasantly surprised. The amount of action was indicative of Marvel’s style and was certainly overdone at the beginning, where the plot could have moved on a little quicker, But there were also moments where you were just allowed to breathe.\\n\\nThey spent time showing character interactions that made people’s bonds with one another believable and made me care for them, Awkwafina’s character Katy had almost none of Marvel’s standard comic-relief character flaws and instead had mostly delightful interactions with Shang, there were gorgeous slowed down scenes that showed the more peaceful flow of movement of the Ta Lo people, and lastly the story was not told linearly but instead cyclically with constant breaks back into flashbacks. I was extremely impressed by this less formulaic method of storytelling.\\n\\nSpoilers: \\n\\nOne flaw: the instigator for the conflict is a situation where the father is able to be tricked by a mere voice, and that is not completely believable because he has lived for over a thousand years and would have to be smarter than that to have lasted this long. His grief at the loss of his wife would have been more convincing as a motivator for his lack of critical thinking if it had been more recent. \\n\\nI won’t go into too many others. Over all, this is a very solid movie. It might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but at least for me, as someone who likes Eastern media for its focus on character interactions, familial/friend love, cyclical story-telling, and often its focus on complex solutions to problems, this was a nice homage to that.',\n",
       " 'Hands down one of the best MCU Movies. Every actor/actress were believable and the fighting choreography was extremely well choreographed and executed.\\nI also really love that it wasn\\'t a normal Marvel movie with all the jokes, it felt more real in terms of dialogue. \\nThe fighting as well wasn\\'t anything crazy like you\\'d see in a lot of Kung Fu movies, this was more like your classic Jackie Chan stunts, where it\\'s able to be done as a regular human being (obviously that\\'s been training). What I mean by this is, there was no superpowers involved for the martial arts, like no flying, fighting in the air, being able to jump 20 feet in the air, etc.\\nOnly time there was anything extraordinary was when the Ten Rings was being wielded or \"someone\" with actual powers as a guardian.\\n\\nAlthough the movie being a little over 2 hours..You don\\'t feel like it\\'s a drag nor does it feel rushed either. If you\\'ve never read any comics on Shang-Chi (like myself), this film really goes over who he is and his past as well as his father. It doesn\\'t feel forced and doesn\\'t feel like they left anything out either.\\n\\nI know Awkwafina tends to play as the same type of jokester/sisterly/Best Friend character in many of the films she acts in, but her character definitely suited her really well.\\n\\nI\\'ll definitely be watching this again with some friends! HIGHLY Recommend!',\n",
       " 'I went to see Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings by marvel studios in theaters, and this movie has blown me away meaning it was incredible. It has been my dream to see my very first MCU movie in theaters. I’m not going to lie, but this movie truly brought me to see it since I feel a real inspiration for martial arts. But as soon as I saw the movie, the human acting was so strong, incredible, and speechless. This had one of the most definable and meaningful origins in the movie which is dark and emotional. Marvel decided to come up with another flavor that has never existed before. First MCU started with nordic culture with thor, African culture for black panther, and they finally come up with a stunning martial arts/Asian culture that is so satisfying. The mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) was an incredible character in the movie. It made me feel that I want to see this movie again, he’s my favorite character in the movie. Awkwafina was the funniest actor and there isn’t a problem with it since MCU needs humor. Lastly, Simu Liu as Shang chi’s dream of becoming a superhero became true and he did very excellently. This movie has various easter eggs you must know, some of them are teasers while some of them are returning MCU characters. This movie isn’t only a must-watch, but a movie to give a tribute to martial arts culture for those who are true fans of it. I would give this a 9.6/10 perfect score.\\nDon’t forget, there are post-credits!',\n",
       " 'The movie was hands down one of my favorite marvel movies if not the favorite. 1st I love all the camera angles it was filmed beautifully with the lighting and close ups. The action scene were great, yes some of them weren’t fast and hard hitting like were used to in the MCU, but they were put together great and choreographed perfectly. The story line it’s self was great I laughed, cried, was on the edge of my seat, and wanting more, and I think that’s what makes a great marvel movie. I think the cast was put together perfectly and each of them preformed there charters amazingly. Something else that I really admired was how the Chinese culture was portrayed in this movie. Their father also had a great character development, he went from a bad guy, to good, to anti-villain, back to a good guy(in my opinion and the way that I saw it) his character kept me watching because I wanted to see what would happen next with his character development. (Spoilers) I loved how the dad wasn’t the bad guy, he just wanted to get his wife back, he didn’t want power or anything besides her; hence why he brought his family together to go and get her.  I love this movie so much and as a Marvel fan I can say that the studio, directors and anyone else who worked on this movie did great.',\n",
       " 'I. Love. It. \\nFirst off: REPRESENTATION! Yes!!! Finally, we have a current mainstream film, Marvel to boot, where we have representation that extends past the norm. It is such a rarity, and this is preposterous to say this in 2021, but it is such a rarity to have representation for Asian cultures in the main cast, especially when they compose all of the principal characters. This is a discussion we need to keep having until this is a norm, until equal casting, equal representation is a norm, and not a rare thing that warrants celebration. Hats off to Marvel, also for presenting reality; having so much of the dialogue be something other than English and giving us subtitles— I swear the people in Hollywood stupidly think this is a turn off, when it’s not; it’s beautiful and correct (and again, something that has to be celebrated because it so rarely happens in mainstream media). \\nThe movie itself: storyline was completely unique and, it’s Marvel so of course it’s going to be. I also love the backstory because apparently, the lead actor kind of did some Instagram post about Shang-Chi and tagged Marvel and that’s essentially where we got the drive for the movie? and if true I love that. To whoever said this was an “experiment” you should have seen the theater; the only movie I’ve been to since the pandemic started where the theater was PACKED, for the afternoon show at that. \\nThe artistry, the flow; the costume design, all beautiful. I love, love, love the choreography; the fights are so great and original like fighting on a bus, come on! My favorite part aside from the fighting scenes as a whole, was the meeting of Shang-Chi’s parents: that fight/dance/love at first sight moment was magical 💗.\\nThere were some great cameos in there, from Wong (Dr. Strange and “Wong, you’re invited to my wedding!”) and my guy Ethan from You! I didn’t find the Mandarin very funny but the rest of the theater did. I love the casting overall: Simu, Tony, Fala (I could have done without Awkwafina— no shade to her but I just didn’t find her character very funny. I kind of shy away from the comic relief and gravitate toward the dramatic aspect of films, which I wish there was a bit more of here). Diversity meter 79%.\\nOverall: 100% worth the watch. Please go see and support.  I read something that this phase of Marvel’s films is all about representation and, I love Cap, (not so much Iron Man), the Hulk, Spidey, etc… but T’Challa (rip Chadwick 💗) was not enough, Shang-Chi is not enough, we have to keep going until we get to the point where everyone has someone who represents their culture, their identity; where no one is excluded, and everyone is celebrated. \\nYeah… I’m definitely going to see this again on Monday.',\n",
       " 'A visual delight and one of the best Marvel origin stories. Here’s my breakdown:\\n\\nCast - every performance was amazing, I was especially impressed by the exquisite martial arts and was glad that the comedic moments didn’t get in the way of the story or ruin the tone, in fact, Awkwafina’s was one my favorite performances \\n\\nStory - really compelling given the dark history of Shang-Chi’s father and the righteousness it took to rise above him. the sentimentality around his parents’ story was really well done too, and yes, I cried a lil \\n\\nTechnical - every scene had a purpose so the 132-minute runtime goes fast\\n\\nVisual - the magical creatures based on Chinese mythology were my favorite part, they are SO cool. the entire realm of Ta Lo was fascinating to me but maybe that’s bc I’m a ho for magic. visually stunning sets, and the fight scenes were ! especially the entire sequence on the scaffolding\\n\\nAudio - riveting score, I’ve been listening all week and can’t get enough\\n\\nI rate movies on instagram @samanthapann ✨',\n",
       " \"Such an amazing film. Unlike some of the other marvel movies that imo try too hard to be cool or emotional and end up taking themselves way too seriously, Shang-Chi feels very organic in everything it does. The story is well paced and unfolds gradually without feeling like things were being dumbed down or overexplained. The visuals were absolutely stunning, comedic relief was always on point, fight sequences were sleek yet powerful, and Simu Liu's bone structure honestly needs to be praised more, that man is gorgeous (I may or may not have Googled his marital status during the movie). I had high hopes for Shang Chi and it absolutely delivered. Very excited for what's to come next.\",\n",
       " '\\'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\\' is absolutely\\xa0on my list of favorite Marvel movies. 2021 has been full of hyped up films that have ultimately\\xa0left me disappointed, but this one lives up to every bit of its hype.\\xa0\\nThe action from beginning to end was some of the best I\\'ve seen in a Marvel movie or in general in a very long time. The choreography, especially\\xa0when performed\\xa0by Michelle Yeoh, Meng\\'er Zhang, and Fala Chen (and stunt doubles) felt like poetry in motion. Everything was done with so much grace and elegance that I did not want it to end. Simu Liu brought both charisma and charm as Shang-Chi while delivering some amazing action sequences too. He was nothing short of fitting for the role. And to my surprise \"Awkwafina\" was not as unbearable\\xa0as I assumed she would be.\\xa0\\nThe movie does lose some\\xa0momentum in the 3rd act as it slows down a bit and takes a deeper dive into the story, but quickly picks back up as you head into the final battle. The set and CGI used creates some breathtaking shots that adds to the greatness of the film.\\n\\nMarvel fan or not this film is worth going to see.\\n\\n\\n\\n-@dreuxsuave #DreuxsReviews',\n",
       " 'It’s a great addition to the Marvel Universe, as well as the action genre.  Shang Chi is stand-alone enough that you can see it without having seen every other Marvel movie (although seeing those movies let’s you understand the various Easter eggs they’ve put into films; like Trevor Slatery—see All Hail The King on Disney+ beforehand if you can).  \\n\\nIt’s main villain is thought out very well and can be understood.  Making this villain’s motives seem righteous in many aspects.  Though he is just a stepping stone to a bigger threat.\\n\\nIt’s music and score are wonderful.  The CGI is integrated very well; as it looks completely at home and not out of place—like the animals seen at or near the village towards the final act of the movie.  The acting is also great.  Along with the humor in this show, which it has plenty of (thanks Awkwafina and company).\\n\\nThis is a must see; if you don’t like it, you may need to see a doctor to find that brain tumor…\\n\\nSarcasm aside, comparing it to previous Marvel movies, it ranks higher than Black Panther for me right now.  It’s sitting at number two with Endgame at one.',\n",
       " 'The humor did not work for me, but everything else was good to great! Although it was not 100% free of the MCU formula, it still overall felt mostly like its own thing in a very good way and was still quite unlike most MCU movies which was quite a breath of fresh air to see. Also the fighting choreography is EXCELLENT and some of the best since John Wick Chapter 3 and the bathroom fight scene from Mission Impossible Fallout. When it comes to Awkwafina... she was not horrible, but I did not find her funny to be honest, but her character did stick to being serious in the serious scenes instead of ruining them with unneeded comedy which was nice. Also Tony Leung was FANTASTIC as a villain! He was three-dimensional and was great overall as not just a villain but a human. Also I must say... I usually don\\'t like excessive cgi BS, but even the CGI was very nice to see even when used in the fights/action pieces where punches don\\'t land and true martial arts isn\\'t the focus. I thought I\\'d hate the more CGI fights but I was quite surprised. \\n\\nI\\'m not the biggest MCU fan honestly... there\\'s still a good amount of MCU movies I very much enjoyed like Homecoming, Winter Solider, and quite a bit more, while others like Black Panther and Endgame were very \"meh\" to \"ok\" for me... this movie was absolutely an extremely pleasant surprise though. Easily in my top 5 MCU films, a very enjoyable film that feels different enough than other more  formulaic-ish Marvel movies, and while I didn\\'t find it to be a 10/10, it is still DAMN good, and if you\\'re an action fan (The Raid 1/2, Ip Man, John Wick, any other martial arts movies) then I think you\\'ll enjoy it even more! HIGHLY recommend, and I\\'m very happy to see this movie doing well, and I wouldn\\'t mind buying this on bluray and seeing it again.\\n\\n8/10 : VERY Good',\n",
       " 'Shang-chi : Legend of ten rings. My first problem with this movie is the title for me the more appropriate title of movie would have been \"Shang-chi and the legend of Ta lo\" because in this movie we get to know more about Ta lo then the rings.\\n\\nThis movie is totally a movie for mass audience like any other MCU movie except a few and It is a great martial art movie and great to see the impact of asian culture in MCU now but still I feel lack at so many places.\\n\\nLike the death dealer was not used as per his potential, I mean he is death dealer he trains the army of ten rings so I am quite disappointed with his portrayal in movie similarly like Task master in Black widow only used for hype creation.\\n\\nThis is a fantacy movie so they have to use CGI and VFX and I have no problem with that and they gave us few new fighting sequence as well as few inspired sequence which is not a problem so no complaint there.\\n\\nPeople are asking question about post credit scenes which is good but I have few different questions. Now after xialing took over Ten rings are they still working with Ta Lo. Does razer fist and xialing still have their mystic weapons which they used to kill demons because if they have, they are also potential threats.\\n\\nI was really offended by the usage of \"Ben Kingsley\" you made fun of him in Iron man 3 and now also in this movie also we don\\'t know where is he now because now he has so much knowledge about the real 10 rings also he can communicate with mystic being which makes him dangerous. Marvel should provide place to \"Ben Kingsley\" where he can be what we want him to be.\\n\\nTherefore I can consider this movie a 🌟🌟🌟🌟 movie.\\n\\nThank you!',\n",
       " 'It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography. Visual effects combined with the martial arts looks very pleasing and well executed. Another new world of fantasies and mystical creatures seems enthralling. But what the movie has in abundance brought through  visual richness lacks a strong storyline for an orgin story. Am not sure if comic fans have read shang chi comics (i havent) but the movie definitely didnt do justice for the character unlike other marvel movies that beautifully set the characters along first 4 phases. I was eager to see this new addition in the franchise and came out feeling mixed about the movie. There are lot of worthwhile action packed sequences along with the usual marvel lighthearted humor. A one time worthwhile watch for ant marvel fan or for that matter super hero fanatics. 1ould rtebthis one closer to Thor dark world',\n",

You will get everything you need from a Marvel flick. \\n\\nShang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings gives a new look at a new hero. It\\'s fresh and it\\'s entertainment at best. To start with positive aspects, the performance as usual are Good. Marvel never misses their castings. Everyone gave their best. Especially the leads Liu and Lueng. Both portrayed themselves perfectly. I was expecting Awkwafina to be a cringe, but she didn\\'t disappointed. Action just brilliant, flawless. The screenplay is elegant. Seeing what new Marvel is showing and what more is about to come will crave fans and everyone for more. Especially the concept of Ten Rings. The mysticism and spiritual material is displayed brilliantly. Fantasy at it\\'s peak. The CGI is just.. flawless as usual. Works tooo damn neat. \\n\\nThe bad aspects of the movie I consider is the Wenvu\\'s (Leung) unsatisfactory agenda. He\\'s clearly a brilliant intimidating villian but with his agenda, he seems nothing but a Delusional guy. The Wong and Abomination arc shown in the trailers fails to deliver any justice. The guy, so they say \"Death Dealer\" was supposed to be a prominent badass, but they wasted his potential. And Marvel can\\'t keep re-using the formula of \"Big Third Act\",\\xa0 \"Good vs. Evil\", with loads of CGI, they have to use and start giving new screenplays for climax. (also the last thing with Katy being sudden Hawkeye in the climax is just.. facepalm. No way they did that!) \\n\\nNevertheless, the movie works fine. Along with superb cinematography, good direction and decent background score. Go watch this movie, you\\'ll enjoy and have a good time. Must watch. Not a definite Marvel Masterpiece, but works and balances well with Humor and Outstanding Action. \\n\\nShang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings: 4/5 Stars.',\n",
       " \"Wow, I really loved this film, and this came as a surprise to me because I didn't have much expectations at all for Shang-Chi before I stepped into the cinema. The fight scene in the bus just screamed Cool, cool, cool, cool and Katy (portrayed by Awkwafina) had some mad Initial-D-driving skills. I was also pleasantly surprised that the characters had all correct pronunciation of Chinese, (I wasn't even expecting there to be chinese dialogue in this film). I only had an inkling that Simu Liu (who portrayed Shang Chi) was chinese but grew up in US or somewhere in the west (I googled after the movie, he is Canadian) so I was prepared for some horribly spoken chinese in the movie. Again, I was pleasantly surprised that he spoke good chinese. \\n(Spoiler:)\\nAnd Wenwu (portrayed by Tony Leung) played this villian so well, I didnt even think he was the villain by the end of the show. He just seemed like a father who missed his wife so terribly that in his grief, he failed to cherish his remaining family, his precious children, whom he neglected on his path to vengeance and then his misguided retrieval of his dead wife to reunite his once happy family. I though Awkwafina was just so adorably cute as Katy. I know Shang chi and Katy are like, long term old platonic friends here, but I do hope they get together, their characters are just so cute together! To be honest, I was trying to calculate their ages during the movie when Shang chi said he escaped at 14, and his sister took 6 years to realize that she could be independent, that she established her underground fighting arena by 16, and their father said Shang chi had left them 10 years ago. If my maths is correct, that would put Shang chi at 24 and his sister Xialing at 20? 🤔 My maths could be wrong though. \\nThe action, fighting scenes, story, characters, graphics, were all so good as compared to my expectations. All the actor/ actresses nailed their characters so good. Looking forward to more stories of Shang chi and the Ten Rings.\",\n",
       " \"I had so much hope after hearing about how good it is... \\n\\nTop class action scenes, great VFX and amazing CGI, well choreographed Asian type fight scenes and a decent amount of suspense were well done .... But...\\n\\nSpoiler alert --- \\n\\nQuite disappointed with the plot, lack of character development and pockets of way too stereotypical representation of Asian culture, not to mention inconsistencies like calling the grandma waipo but addressing the dad in a very Americanised way. I mean hello growing up for 14 years with your dad in a Chinese environment... their interactions dosent seem to reflect that and it feels off for some reason, like how he called Dad dad and not 爸. Also, his death was so anti-climax and evoked zero feels. Dosen't seem like the mum imparted traditional Asian values to her children, something typical to Asian culture - except teaching him how to fight her way so he can defeat the bad guy. Hmm or I may have missed out smth.\\n\\nBit of a blah plot - thought that the pendent will be such an integral part of the story but no, just a map, oh and actual villan turned out to be some soul sucking godzilla??? SC suddenly became almighty powerful and is able to control 10 rings that has no backstory in this film - the first film of SC in MCU? The revelation of the mum's death was also bit messily unveiled\\n\\nOh also, SC's trauma and brokenness from his early years didn't seem telling. The way he dealt with the pain of watching his mum die, and what we might expect - blaming himself for mum's death and his utter determination to avenge for it, seeing traumatic killings as a little boy, and his stone cold dad treatment just didn't seem to come through in his overall character. Felt like the entire focus of the movie was just pure action. Unlike other MCUs like black widow, iron Man & spider Man, the character development was an utter disappointment. \\n\\nStill, it was nice to see tony leung and Michelle yeoh. \\n\\nDisappointed because this could have had way more potential for a large scale Asian themed MCU. If you're bored, I highly recommend cruella on Disney+. It was a surprising delight\",\n",
       " \"What a unique style of storytelling that stands out from any of Marvel's other standalone titles. I personally grew up watching kung fu and Asian fighting movies, so this movie just felt so nostalgic at times. The fighting was delicates in ways unlike the other Marvel movies, where humor was mixed into the fights, and at times reminiscent of classics like House of Flying Daggers.\\n\\nEven though you've never met these characters before, you understand them and fall in love with them. Their stories and motives are easy to get and you just accept them right away.\\n\\nNot to mention how beautiful the costuming was. Marvel is on a roll right now, for real\",\n",
       " 'AWESOME! Anyone who likes martial arts mixed with fantasy will get more than their money\\'s worth for this fast paced action love story. One on one fights and battle scenes with some \"God of War\" type heart pounding moves is best enjoyed in 3D. Well cast, stunning visuals and an epic final battle of how I pictured BAHAMUT  vs TIAMAT  having a little spat for you D&D fans.\\nTwo normal people thrust into a 1000 year old blood feud  conflict - theres a new Marvel Ultra hero and his name is SHANG CHI!! ..and cute Katy.',\n",
       " \"I went into this movie with all my expectations set aside. You could tell that a lot of love was put into the making of this movie, with the integration of older MCU characters, the CGI, choreography and the soundtrack. \\n\\nWhen I left the theatre on premiere night, I immediately looked up the soundtrack. The music really helped bring the story to life, setting up each plot point. Even in the slower scenes, the music was integrated perfectly- which helps give Shang Chi it's identity.\\n\\nTony Leung stole every scene he was in. Through his eyes, viewers are able to read his emotional, sincerity and love for his family. His action felt justifiable- in that he really wanted what he thought was best for his family, which felt relatable coming from an Asian household. \\n\\nThe supporting cast of this movie really help set up for Simu's character to play off of. To me his character was really likable, but it felt like they didn't want to take a risk writing an Asian male lead. \\n\\nThe Mid-credit scene got me really excited for the future of Simu in the MCU. Hopefully giving him more room to shine as an A list Avenger. Sit back, relax and enjoy this movie, as it has a lot to offer- it's brilliant soundtrack, legendary actors, hard hitting choreography, and the dedication/love put into the making of this movie!\",\n",
       " '“A beautiful film in every way, shape, and form.” That’s the quote i’ve been repeating in my head ever since i saw the movie yesterday. It breaks the mold of typical superhero movies and the film industry in general in so many ways. And the visuals!!! I would willingly watch the entire movie on mute if only to see the beautiful visuals. \\n\\nYou can feel the effort and love that was put into every single moment. Throughout the movie I kept thinking, “this would be such good material for an analysis paper!” There are so many meaningful moments that can’t be noticed on a surface level, its the kind of film you can watch a million times and still notice something new. And I can’t express how gorgeous the visuals are. A meaningful film that has changed the marvel universe, and the world. It’ll go down in history, you’d really be missing out to not see it.',\n",
       " 'Just watched this with friends today! Incredible visuals and an even more talented cast that blew me away with a cohesive story, comedy, and action. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings had me gripped, and I would definitely rewatch it.\\n\\nThe movie also highlights some parts of Asian culture and brings some much-needed representation to the big screen, which the cast and writing does a great way of showing.\\n\\nThe only reason I would not rate it a 5 is because there are some aspects of its story that can be a bit confusing, especially if you have not watched certain MCU films. However, it works very well as a standalone movie with interesting implications for future films, so get out there and go watch it!',\n",
       " \"This movie was fantastic! The camera work was incredible and never boring to watch. Visually, it was a masterpiece of color and energy. The action was the best we have had in the MCU since Spiderman took out Mysterio's drones. The final fight scene finally escaped the trope of the villain and hero having the exact same power, which was what I was expecting from the trailer going into the movie. The movie also did such an incredible job splicing in backstory at just the right moment that it was engaging and made the characters more interesting instead of distracting from the plot. There are some criticisms I have of the movie, such as the reliance on the trope of a perfectly peaceful society that gets attacked as a backstory/setting, the trope of killing off the villain right when he is at the point of redemption and could have an interesting character arc, and finally just the way that some of the jokes fell flat. But as a whole, this is undeniably the most unique and creative movie to be made this year, and it was incredible to get to watch it in theaters with the full super hero experience!\",\n",
       " \"Breathtakingly fun like riding a water dragon!  Marvel's Shang-Chi succeeds where so many East meets West films fails.    Thematically, very much an Eastern film - the emphasis on family, ancestry, and ethics - yet it's also courageously irreverent in many respects Asians with Western values or exposure.  \\n\\nOne nice touch is how respects the audience enough to use Mandarin! - the spoken language! - as well as Ben Kingsley! :).   Part Hidden Tiger, part Enter the Dragon, and part Police Story - there's  such thoughtful nuanced performances by the entire cast.  And Tony Leung's performance is awesome!\\n\\nOverall, just a wonderfully crafted movie!  Thank you cast and crew!\",\n",
       " \"The movie is both a beautiful homage to classic martial arts movies AND a wonderful story of love, loss, grief, and the bonds between parents and their children and how they can warp and break.  The acting is impeccable top to bottom, Simu Liu is a STAR (seriously, what can't the guy do?! I saw a video on Twitter of him playing guitar and singing beautifully, too) and Awkwafina and Tony Leung TRULY shine as well.  My only tiny quibble was a couple of the cgi effects looked a little rubber band-ish a couple times, like when a body flies across the screen or things like that. This quibble is not enough to get me to knock my review down from 5 stars though.  An absolutely epic movie.  A triumph.  Must-see, in theaters.\",\n",
       " 'Marvel is back, dear. Today I watched Shang - Chi. It was so amazing. I really like that MCU is getting diverse day by day. The Fighting scenes were really awesome and well cinematographed. You will get a complete feel of thrilling martial arts with the vibe of Marvel. One thing I loved the most was Shang-chi alone was not able to defeat the villains. Other characters also played an important role in his success. All characters contributed their best to create a good storyline. The storyline was simple but fresh. The cast crew was fine (the actors were awesome). MCU movies are always a great mixture of Drama, Actions, Humor, and fantasies. And being an MCU movie Shang- Chi is full of these factors. Dear Marvel fans, make sure that you should watch this movie. An introduction of a new superhero in our MCU world.',\n",
       " \"This movie was amazing. I am a big fan of how post Endgame content has shifted from focusing on Humans who built their power (From Serum/Biology/Technology) and bringing in Non-Human elements that our characters are learning through, and dealing with. \\n\\nThe story of Shang Chi in particular was great. It had great pacing since we were learning all about multiple characters history in a short time during the events of the story. The fighting scenes were really fun to watch, the CGI looked amazing, the costuming is so gorgeous, and the world they created is very interesting and not like anything we've seen.\",\n",

However, after about 30 minutes, it really started growing on me.  I love how it doesn't feel like other Marvel movies.  It has its own unique style and feel to it. The CGI and cinematography were absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking, and it was definitely the most beautiful Marvel movie I've ever seen.\\nThe acting was great.  Simu Liu did a fantastic job portraying Shang-Chi's character, and Awkwafina provided lots of funny quips and comments.  The humor was a touch out of place at times, but it still made me laugh and smile.  \\nI was also surprised to find myself tearing up at certain parts.  This movie definitely tugged on my heartstrings a bit.  I think that Shang Chi's backstory could have been developed a bit more, but he was still a great and likeable character.\\nOverall, the movie was fantastic, and it was incredibly enjoyable to watch.  I'd definitely recommend it, and I will be seeing it again!\",\n",

Super enjoyable for those who know the MCU through and through, as well as those who haven’t seen a single movie. \\n\\nPacing, script, VFX, casting, and score are all on point. The most emotionally impactful moments come in the first two acts, and those moments don’t feel lost or dulled by the action in the third act (which sometimes does happen in these movies). Commend the unexpectedly substantial use of chinese with english subs, and the overall treatment of the cultural influences. A big win for the Asian community, and grateful for the opportunity to support Asian representation in Hollywood and Marvel; it expands and enriches the world for everyone. Go see it with your family and as many friends as possible—the movie is beautiful, emotionally resonant, and humorous in a classically-Marvel way. Definitely a favorite.',\n",
       " \"One of the best marvel movies I've ever seen. The acting was well done, fight scenes were breathtaking and the story while predictable was still enjoyable to watch. The best part is that this movie could very well stand on its own and still be great. What I also enjoy was the lack of a romantic story line with the main protagonist. It let the story focus on what was happening and made it feel more urgent and could move at a faster pace. I don't think there was ever a lag in the movie but it also isn't as long as a normal marvel movie. It also has that classic marvel comedy. each of the main characters had growth and played an important role in the development of the story. Marvel keeps leveling up what female characters can do and become. Stong, funny, dynamic, determined and human. \\nThis is a great start to the next phase. Will be seeing it again!\",\n",
       " \"Marvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction. \\n\\nThe main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao. Meaning if Shang Chi and his sister Xuling we're just slightly better at guarding their Jade stones which they kept around their necks, their father would have not been able to get through Tao Lao for another year. Which is why the necklaces come across as a mere lazy plot convince, the same as the chicken pig which was never even explained as to why it was at the ten rings compound in the first place. If anything it would have been more satisfying to see more of the alternate dimensions world, the cities, the people, the creatures. This could have easily have been done though having Shang Chi and Katy arrive and stay in Tao Lao a whole year before their father would have been able to get there with them into Tao Lao. This would make it much more believable that Shang Chi and even Katy would have the strength and ability to fight off the horde of soul suckers and big bad papa's ten rings bad men. \\n\\nAlthough the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6.5 out of 10 Krispy score.\",\n",

Awkwafina was in all her Awkwafina glory and Simu Liu along with the rest of the cast did great. For me, the show stealer was Tony Leung Chiu-Wai.

The cinematography was A+, the acting was great, there wasn't an Oscar performance by anyone but it's what you expect out of a good tier Marvel movie. This was the first proper Asian-American lead film by Hollywood and I'm glad to have lived to see the day where we weren't a mockery or stereotype on the big screen.

Another aspect that blew my mind was the fighting choreography, which pulled no punches (no pun intended). At the start of the movie, we\\'re instantly drawn in by Wenwu\\'s duel with his future wife in the forest. Later, I was also very much impressed with Shang-Chi\\'s fight with the \"Death Dealer\" in the Macau fight club.\\n\\nAs for the acting, Tony Leung absolutely carried this movie. You could see the raw emotion in his eyes in every scene. He put on an absolute masterclass and stole every scene he was in. One of my favorite scenes is when Wenwu mercilessly kills all the members of the rival gang after his wife\\'s death. Simu Liu definitely put on a good performance, but his character wasn\\'t memorable in my view. I would apply that same criticism to Awkwafina\\'s character Katy.\\n\\nSome other highlights: The return of Trevor Slattery from Iron Man 3 was a pleasant surprise, and the levity Ben Kingsley added to the movie. The return of familar faces like Wong, Emil Blonsky, Captain Marvel, and Hulk. I also enjoyed the setup for a Shang-Chi sequel and an appearance in a future Avengers movie. \\n\\nSome lowlights: I don\\'t think \"Death Dealer\" was used as good as he could have been. He has a brief fight scene with Shang at the start of the movie and disappears until the end of the movie, where he gets killed instantly by a soul snatcher. Although he is the titular character, Shang-Chi was out-shadowed by his father Wenwu in this film.\\n\\nSummary: Overall, a very family-friendly film which will no doubt be of importance to the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Multiverse?).',\n",

       " 'This was definitely one of the best MCU origin stories. I\\'d put it in the top five MCU origin stories. Marvel did a good combining the different styles of martial arts in this movie. Shang-Chi incorporated the traditional \"Crouching Tiger H.D., Grandmaster, Hero\" style with the more modern crazy \"Jackie Chan\" style. I personally have a sweet spot in my heart for Asian Martial Arts movies, and this left me satisfied. And we can\\'t forget about the AWESOME DBZ reference in which I almost died in my seat. The soundtrack was good, I definitely played the theme song on the way home.',\n",
       " \"'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is absolutely on my list if favourite marvel movies.  It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography. Visual effects combined with the martial arts looks very pleasing and well executed. Another new world of fantasies and mystical creatures seems enthralling. A unique style of storytelling that stands out from any of Marvel's other standalone titles.Overall, the movie was fantastic, and it was incredibly enjoyable to watch. I'd definitely recommend it, and I will be seeing it again! And don't miss out the post and end credit scene.\",\n",
       " \"All that surrounded us of Marvel in this pandemic was limited to OTT platforms, and the theatre experience was somewhat lost. And then this happens and voila! \\nI did expect a lot from this movie, and it delivered way, way beyond them. And the best part,  Shang Chi becoming the newest addition to the Avengers, makes things more anticipating for the future. The ten rings were superb, and to see them in live action was a visual treat. Tony Leung's character was well knit, and especially the way he opened up an army in the first scene with sheer mastery of the power he possessed sort of bound everyone to their seats and then the joyride began. Hats off to Marvel for making such an explosive comeback to the theatres. Looking forward to the next phase!\",\n",
       " \"I'd be remiss if I talk about this film's brilliant performance. From the beginning, the storyline was grounded and had intentional stunts and visual effects, not a lot to deviate from the storytelling and not a little that one wouldn't notice. This is the kind of integration that is very much deserving of a Marvel film. I am biased on the extensive VFX crew as they portrayed creatures, environments, animations, and simulations that felt true to life and served to tell a story without it being distracting, we have truly come a long way. Here's to waiting for Eternals.\",\n",
       " 'This film is very good. It is the best movie in marvel so far. Shang-chi has been one of my favourites because it is exciting and good to watch with family also you can see different marvel characters like Wong from doctor strange and others like hulk, captain marvel. I like this movie because there are lost of martial arts involved and fighting. The fighting clearly seemd kind  of realistic. Awkwafina was really funny and I had a feel laughs.  Good jobs actors. Hope there is a new Shang- Chi movie 2.',\n",
       " \"This movie had so much potential to be good but it just didn't work. Aquafinas parts were cringe most times and they made her way to important for whatever reason. The whole part with the fight club and her almost falling was so stupid due to the fact that all the people trting to catch then were after were the pendant , something neither of them owned , why was she running away like they were after her and why were they so keen on catching this random girl . Then they made it seem like his father was the worst father of all time due to him being immortal and living thru thousands of years. The entire time they had flashbacks you can clearly see his father was supportive and loving up until his wife died with no indication of him even bringing anything baggage of his past with his new family , even giving up using the rings. It made no sense why they had such a bitter hate towards him because he made him train his teen years, which was reveled later that Shang chi chose this path since he was young when his father killed his mothers killer.  Its like they just needed a villain till they got to the end to reveal the 5 min long super bad guy . That being said , the whole 10 rings of ancient magic and amazing God like powers turned out to just be a giant whip with occasional projectiles , and a forcefield that one time. Cool .\",\n",

Going into the movie, I thought that Awkwafina would just be cringe comedic relief but her character actually get like a real character and was much more than the comedic relief. \\n\\nSpoiler alert for those who haven’t watched yet.\\n\\nThe Mandarin is one of the best villains in the MCU. He’s great because you can see where he’s coming from and he’s not just some evil dude trying to take over the world. In fact, but the end of the movie he isn’t even a bad guy. He had a whole character arc that is ended after giving up the rings. Shang-Chi himself is also a great character and a great addition to the franchise. He is the centerpiece of some of the best fight scenes in the MCU, and is a very likable character.',\n",

I just find myself not really caring about the movie and its characters because of everything I stated, especially cause (SPOILERS SPOILERS) they basically allude to the rings being explained in another movie, and I find it awkward cause the line up for this current phase, doesn't have a sequel in it \\n\\n\\nOverall I wish I just waited for it to come out on Disney Plus, and I hope my feeling change after while on this movie, But currently its only worth watching cause everything in the mcu is connected. 2.5 stars\",\n",
       " \"Best Marvel movie I've seen so far!!! Was engaged from beginning to end.  Great plot, fight scenes were the best ever (like watching a ballet!). The characters were relatable and likable, even the villain who was doing what he was doing for love. Awkwafina was great in her role. Also a movie you can take the whole family for lack of foul language. As for the scenery and costume...Breathtaking!!! Reminded me of Avatar. There aren't enough good things I can say about this movie. I rarely see a movie twice, but I am looking forward to seeing this one again!!!!\",\n",
       " 'My God this movie was beautiful AF! I went to see Candyman which was sold out and decided on this. I absolutely loved it. The action/fighting scenes weren’t rushed. The fighting style is beautiful. They had my sense of humor as well (the “jester” - I love humor like that) it was magical but realistic in certain aspects. It was fun, exciting, exhilarating and heartfelt. The characters are easy to fall in love with. I can’t wait to get it on DVD and digital download so I can have it always. Probably the first Marvel movie that I didn’t want to see right off the bat but glad that I did. I want to watch it again!',\n",
       " \"Easily top 5 of my favorite Marvel movies, probably top 3 or higher. I have to see it more than once before I decide. But before I was even back from the theater I wanted to watch it again. Absolutely amazing choreography with the fight scenes(and there was a lot) and stunning sets, special effects, and cgi. Truly a beautiful movie to watch and packed full of action and some really funny moments too. I highly recommend it to everyone whether they've followed previous Marvel movies or not. It's great as a stand-alone film but it also makes me extremely excited for the next phase of marvel films!\",\n",
       " 'Warning: some spoiler alerts. .. \\n\\nHm I suppose it was an alright movie but definitely not one of Marvel’s best and personally I thought Black Widow was better. The script was pretty poor as was the plot and especially the character development. I found myself bored a few times throughout the movie as the pacing was a bit off. I’m not sure if it was too fast or too slow or maybe alternating between both without finding a good pace. The flashbacks of which there were quite a bit were kind of awkwardly placed as they explained a scene from immediately before or immediately after which I believe messed with the plot a little.  When one of the characters die towards the end it didn’t feel nearly as meaningful as it should have been, I’m not sure how i can explain why but it wasn’t moving to me when it likely should have been. I felt the death of a side character (the bow and arrow instructor Guang Bo) more, but perhaps that is just me. \\n\\n Continuing on, some things were kind of left unexplained or with too little detail to make it meaningful like the appearance of the little “chicken pig,” the dragon “Great Protector,” and the “Dweller in Darkness,” who turns out to be the big evil final boss or however you want to put it.  I also found it kind of idiotic that the main characters Shang Chi, Katie, and Xialing, were in incredible disbelief about the existence of magic and an alternate dimension where their own mother came from, especially after witnessing Wong from Dr. Strange open portals etc. Overall the film had a certain lackluster and I’d probably blame it on the director more than anything else as the actors did what they could. \\n\\nOn the plus side the fight scenes were really cool as were the scenes when they finally arrive to Ta-Lo where Shang Chi’s mother is from. \\n\\nIt was an OK movie and could have been done a lot better. Would I watch it again? Probably not, but I don’t necessarily regret watching it.',\n",
       " \"Eh. The entire plot was super predictable, and it was definitely aimed at a younger audience. Most of the jokes weren't funny, and Shang-Chi's friend was just there for comic relief. THAT'S IT. She was completely useless except for the moment she turned into Legolas and got insanely good at the bow and arrow with 4 minutes of practice. Also, I didn't think I would see anyone riding a dragon in a Marvel movie. It was soooo out of place. This movie actually reminded me of Raya and the Last Dragon. Shang-Chi should have been the live-action Mulan we were all waiting for, not a Marvel movie. However, the CGI was good, as always, and the fight scenes were well choreographed. It also had some end-credit scenes that are important to the future of MCU's phase 4, so definitely worth watching. Black Widow was a much better movie overall, although that wasn't a perfect film either. Shang-Chi got 3/5 stars in my opinion, don't trust Rotten Tomatoes.\",\n",
       " '4 1/2 out of 5, really great overall, the fight choreography was seriously well thought out and done. The story while being a bit formulaic in some areas is much better than most MCU films. The cast all did well especially Tony Leung. This really feels like a throwback to old Kung Fu adventure films but given the big budget Marvel treatment made by people who truly understand the source material and a director who was clearly passionate about the project as well as it’s lead.',\n",

Fala Chen, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Benedict    Wong, Meng' er Zhang awesome, awesome, awesome. It brings Asian fantasy finally to America.

What is it with people that can’t embrace other cultures? Or is this simply an American matter? This film was absolutely fantastic, the storyline was adjusted to avoid disgusting stereotypes and came out with a very relatable storyline for everyone everywhere. This is probably more of a game changer than Black Panther was, to be honest, only because Shang-Chi threw us in the deep of their family issues and got it to stick.

I saw this movie opening night and it was fantastic!!!! The characters were great, I loved how there was no forced romance. I loved how they focused on hand to hand combat differentiating itself from other marvel movies where they used guns and weapons. The visuals and music were jaw dropping too.

       " 'The movie started out good with the early fighting sequences standing out. I think casting was great and character development moves at a decent pace during the first half of the movie. However, the story moves quite slowly and it loses its momentum in the second half. The fantastic elements that begin to pop up feel a bit in your face and get more attention that they deserve. The final arc was kind of underwhelming and anticlimactic both in its action and in wrapping up the story. The excessive nods to Chinese culture elements become unnecessarily stereotypical and the final battle feels more like a mashup of “Mulan” and “How to train your dragon” than a MCU movie. In the end, the characters are salvageable, even though at times it felt as if the story was more about Tony Leung’s character than Shang-Chi himself, I just hope Marvel finds a better way to incorporate him and its lore into the MCU where it doesn’t feel forced, like they did with Captain Marvel.',\n",

It portrayed Asian culture and the mastery of Tai chi elegantly.

Maybe because it resonated with a lot of what my family went through in terms of internal unrest but thought it was a captivating story alongside the stunning visual effects.

       " 'Fantastic origin story. The creative fight scenes had beautiful camera work, and were fluid without annoying jump cuts. The cast had great chemistry and one in particular had a great character arc. The film makers did their homework on making the mythology come to life and not white washing the cast and fixing some of the questionable things from this character’s comic origins while still maintaining his essence. The cinematography was gorgeous. No complaints here.',\n",

From the very beginning, the fight scenes, cinematography, Mandarin language usage, etc. Everything is intentional.

       " 'Shang-Chi was such an amazing experience! So many surprises, one after the other! It is such a beautifully made film from the cinematography, visuals, settings, and music. The fighting choreography was extremely well done. Probably some of the best fighting scenes since Winter Soldier. The pacing is great and there is so much that is fit into the movie without it feeling forced or rushed. And the set ups for what is to come is EPIC!!! I can’t recommend it any more!!!',\n",

Shang Chi is the refreshing film everyone needs to see. The film itself is beautiful, it captures truly captures each character’s emotions, contains great humor, and the artistry behind the action packed martial arts is breath taking. I must say Simu Liu embodies this character so well',\n",

Actor Simu Liu is new to MCU and he will soon join his speed to famous in a comic book role which is for first time in a live action film, Talking about the movie, the movie is enjoyable,  can be enjoyed most in English, the film has long battles but it will touch your want of action, There are great actors in film, good direction, a cool background music, and for it's MCU connection, it has a mid credit scene and a sequel preparation from the post credit scene,  You can see some remarkable comic beings I'm film, Ben Kingsley, Tim Roth, Benedict Wong and two more actors connect it back to McU, the events of this film is might be filmed near Proffesoer Jill's snap just before the showdown .I will give this film 7 rating out of 10.It might releases late on Disney + but now if can, Try to enjoy it in theatres .\",\n",

Great movie.',\n",

When you throw in great performances from Akwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and Ben Kingsley in addition to an all-time villain MCU performance by Tony Leung, what could possibly go wrong? CGI... a little too much unneeded CGI in the dramatic world-building battle scene. However, it does not take away from the great stuff put on screen. Worth every penny!\",\n",

I would rate it at 8.5/10.',\n",

So glad they were there to bless this wonderfully made, casted & directed movie with their presence. Awkwafina is a natural when it comes to delivering humor and sass.

       " 'Ten out of ten amazing movie. Me, my brother, and sister loved this movie. A little spoiler if you never watched it, is that the bug fight at the end reminded me of a Godzilla fight but at the same time the humans were really involved. I also really felt for the dad he might have been evil before but when he had his wife it brought him hope and made him good but once he lost her he broke. Over all the movie was really solid.',\n",

I loved the music and the sets were fantastic. \\n\\nCons: Way too much CGI and I could certainly tell when they were in front of a green screen.  After the first fight scene it felt like it tapered off, almost like they got a bit lazy with it.  It just seemed to be more fake and staged rather than feeling like real fighting if that makes sense.  Also my boyfriend pointed out that in the actual comics the 10 rings are very different.  Each ring on each finger has a completely different power.  Learning this I feel like this was a missed opportunity on their part because that would've been really cool.  \\n\\nOverall I would give this movie a 7/10.  Its a good popcorn muncher and not a bad movie to sit through.  I just think they could've done a lot more with it.\",\n",

He was neither imposing figure nor a cerebral adversary. I thought the film set up pretty well in the first act, act and a half but went for big screen spectacle in lieu of finishing off a well crafted story.  I get that it’s the MCU and in the end it’s all spectacle to some extent but it works better when you have a good story. Ben Kingsleys character is idiotically Jar-Jar Binks’d into another MCU film, and it  really started to lose me in one of the hokiest car chase scenes ever when Trevor Slattery, an Ewok with no face and the three main characters are driving through an enchanted forest in a funny car.  Hope Eternals delivers better than this.',\n",

THIS GUY is clueless enough to have a bunch of run of the mill thugs just walk in while he's shopping and kill his wife in front of his kids? Give me a break.  My daughter wrote a better screenplay in 8th grade, true story. Ben Kinsley was great, but had no business being in this story. It was almost as if they were sticking him in to fulfil a contractual obligation. WAIT! Almost forgot! They also stick in some ewok/R2D2 critter whose chittering when conveniently translated to English gives us the deus ex machina answers to solve the big dilemma that's thwarted others for millennia.

The conversation that the father had in the importance of one\\'s name is powerful.

If this movie had been streamlined and had one dominant genre (think Winter Soldier or Gaurdians of the Galaxy), I would have loved it.

       " 'The movie was WAY better than I had expected. Marvel has been progressively upping their game, and this movie continues that trend. It was emotionally resonant, it was more about story than effects, with the result being that the effects consequently had more impact. As it was making a nod to many wuxia films, the martial arts scenes were excellent, and the choreography was not stale, which had been a worry. HOWEVER, this would have been better if they had NOT tried to insert comedic moments. They need to stop characterizing audiences as being so shallow that each movie \"must have comedy\". It\\'s insulting to the intelligence of moviegoers. Marvel needs to simply dive into the dramatic end of the pool, and give us a story that is not watered down by \"comic relief valve moments\". ESPECIALLY as this was a nod to Asian cinema Hong Kong Triad movies and wuxia movies, the comedy is a distraction from the story and interruption of the rhythm. Nonetheless, it benefits from the presence of Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh, whose screen presence and gravitas are actually the real anchors of the movie. Get rid of the \"light-hearted\" content, I say. Awkwafina, whom I admire and respect, seemed out-of-place due to her role as snark-provider. And thankfully, it isn\\'t the same old story just about stopping \"the bad guy that wants to end the world\", \"the bad guy that wants to take over the world,\" \"the bad guy wants to bla bla bla\". That element is present, but that isn\\'t what the movie concentrates on ; it is centered on family dynamics, and gets more mileage because of it.',\n",

If there's one movie I think would actually ever stand a chance against this that is released this year... Its Spider-Man No Way Home, that's the only 2021 true competitor to this movie. The direction was great. The pacing was a little fast, but Im okay with it. The action scenes were incredible, like the bus fight, if you were a real person who was exactly like Shang Chi, it would turn out exactly like that, which makes the fight scenes realistic. The best character in the movie is hands down Wenwu. Tony Leung did an amazing job at showing true emotions as if he was actually Wenwu. I wish I could mention more but this is just a Google review, not an IGN review article. But I just want to mention... The music was incredible, action was incredible, story was incredible, and acting is incredible. Definitely a have to watch. If I had a choice to watch Endgame or this.... Hands down this.\",\n",

The plot made no sense and the entire time it sets up a villain that doesn't pay off and instead defaults to some horrific demon monster from beyond that's totally not explained and no one should have to worry about ever again apparently. But that's just par for the course because it also doesn't explain magical place in which the story happens, it doesn't explain where the rings came from, it doesn't explain really anything properly. It's just not a great movie. It's too bad because the cast was great and I feel like they could have done justice as to a better film.\",\n",

       " \"Not a strong film in the slightest. I had very high hopes for this movie, I saw the trailer and thought that it might be something different with it's cool setting and antagonist. I was sorely let down. For starters, the acting was beyond awful. The emotional scenes didn't land. They came off very robotic, whether it was the main character talking about his sad past or his sister explaining her hardship, there wasn't much good acting and I can't tell if it was bad directing or if the actors were just not great. The funny scenes weren't all that great either, just generic marvel humor, (which isn't a bad thing) but coupled up with the lead and his love interest made for some really unfunny moments that came off as campy and try hard. The plot was all over the place too, I won't spoil (I should honestly, to save you a headache) but it was awful. Full of plot holes, it felt rushed. You can tell too at the end of the movie for it to make sense they threw in some random flashbacks to try and piece it together, but they were just beating a dead horse. The character's arcs weren't present, the characters you first meet don't change at all by anything at the end of the movie in the slightest. No development or anything to speak of. The dialogue is very unnatural and could have used some revisions to make it more human. On a positive note the fights scenes were well done. They way they used the environments and the environments they actually fought in were well done and fun to watch. The martial arts was really enjoyable, and it was fun to watch some of the fight scenes, even it didn't make sense for them to be fighting. The soundtrack was pretty as well, marvel always does that so not much to be said other than the fact that the use of asian instruments were very fresh while adding some theming to the setting the characters were in. Overall bad movie with a horrible plot, awful acting, but had some redeeming qualities (although not enough to save the film) in the fight scenes and soundtrack.\",\n",

If you found the fight scenes boring, you must be a chronic video game player!  I found the writing to be committed.  I adored the storyline.  I loved the fact that the mother was the only one who had ever beaten the father.

       " \"Very enjoyable escapist fun.  Good action sequences and good performances all around.  There was a sort of start-stoo quality to the movie which made the movie a little choppy but still I'll watch it again. A good start to, hopefully, many movies and stories for this new Marvel hero.  And don't forget the end credits.  The first one was great but the second... Meh.  They should've switched it around so we end on a high note.\",\n",
       " 'This movie was so much fun! Saturated with color, creative fight scenes, and gorgeous music in the background. We really enjoy marvel movies in general, but this one felt much more unique compared to their standard action movies. Getting us excited for what will come in the future!',\n",
       " 'The movie is Mesmerising!! From the graphics to exceptional cast to all those insane Fighting scenes. The amount of efforts and time the whole team gave can be seen. Watch and loved every bit of it. Its fun, adventurous, full of action and kumg fu! Simply perfect!! What a intro for Asian marvel movie!!!😭♥️♥️',\n",
       " 'This is the best MCU origin story ever! The movie is full of emotions and display topics of family, love, change, etc very well. The acting and chemistry between all the actors/actresses were amazing! The movie was entertaining throughout! Shang-chi will clearly plan a huge part in the phase 4 of the MCU! A MUST WATCH!!',\n",
       " 'I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys both action films and social equality. This should be the way for a decade ago. Thanks that this first Asian American led marvel movie is made happened. Meanwhile, do appreciate the Chinese culture though is not much haha. Thank you for reading my review!!!',\n",
       " 'I thought it was exceptionally well done. The acting, the direction, the visuals, and the story. The story incorporated Chinese myth and legend, and yet stayed true to the MCU. It was not fully true to the Comic books, but the storyline was even better. It actually was a long way from some martial arts film ripoff, although that was part of the story. I think people will be looking forward to the next Shang Chi film.',\n",
       " 'Thank Marvel for having Leung Chui-wai in this movie. I find myself always fall into his eyes any time I see him in a movie. He has a pair of eyes full of sadness, or say emotions that make people want to protect and love him. This is just a background movie for Shang-chi, but a totally love tragedy for Leung. You can enjoy Tony in suits, white shirt or Chinese traditional clothes, and definitely, his mandarin with a little accent.',\n",
       " 'Walking out of the theater thinking to myself how does Marvel continue to get better! This movie was phenomenal. Strong storytelling, perfect fight scenes, and the way Marvel implemented culture into this film. I recommend this movie to everyone even if you aren’t a marvel fan. Great job!',\n",
       " 'As a marvel fan I’m disappointed it barely attached itself to the rest of the MCU and didn’t answer and of the questions marvel lovers have been waiting way too long for, but I did love this movie. Cast was perfect, action was amazing, story telling was amazing, lore building was amazing, music was amazing, I’m thoroughly impressed and I loved it. \\nIt also made me excited for what they’ll bring to the MCU regarding Asian culture and I’m now more excited that Atlantis is supposed to get a South American reimagining.',\n",
       " 'This movie is amazing. I watched it yesterday (9/11/21) at a Regal Cinema in Elk Grove with my dad and my brother. I would definitely watch this movie again and I would recommend it to all of my friends. My favorite part was the very last scene after the credits when Shang-Chi said, \"We could sleep orrrrrrr...\" and the Shang-Chi, Katy, and Wong start singing \"Hotel California\"',\n",
       " \"Spectacular!!!! I don't even like super hero movies, I went because my daughter wanted to go. I will see it again and I'm hoping for a follow up. I think this was visually stunning and the Chinese culture added heart to the story. The cast was amazing and it was great to finally see their culture showcased in such a beautiful way on the big screen.\",\n",
       " 'Loved the movie. Saw it in Imax 2d. Tony Leung stole the spotlight when he\\'s shown on screen as the Mandalorian. The rest of the cast is EPIC.\\n If you\\'re a fan of Stephen Chow\\'s movies such as \" Kung fu hustle\" nor \"Shaolin Soccer\" there\\'s familiar actors in there that has worked with Chow\\'s. These are all great actors, familiar and new. I recon everyone to go see it.',\n",
       " \"AMAZING!!! At first my hype wasn't high for this film, but as the first 2 trailers dropped, my hype was out the roof. The action definitely did not disappoint and it is one of my favourite marvel films ever. Definitely would recommend and loved that final fight.\",\n",
       " \"I am from China, and I don't like this movie. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!\\nShang-Chi is a pretty fantastic movie that shows a coherent and fascinating story in which many characters speak authentic Chinese and show the Cultural pride itself. I know many people in China hate this movie; I totally understand because they are so annoyed that Asian-Americans can be one part of the mainstream and live in their own culture with confidence.\",\n",
       " 'Of all the kung-Fu movies I seen, this new Marvel comic-book movie did it again only better! I seen this movie twice in theaters and for what I love this one: the fast fighting scenes took me by surprise & most of all I like to give extra credit to Simu for giving us the best performance as Shang-chi, Awkwafina for always being funny & did heroic stuff in this movie and finally Tony for playing the greatest main villain in this movie I ever seen!!!!',\n",
       " 'Shang Chi hit so hard man. It was a great combination of Chinese mythological background with blockbuster fight scenes. Marvel is working on really great projects. Hats off for producing such an awesome Asian dominated movie, showing badass girl power at the mid credits and so on.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely stunning. One of the best MCU movies to date and top 10 greatest comicbook movie of all time. Shang-Chi is amazing. Best superhero action in a very long time and lots of depth and great storytelling that really separate this from other superhero movies. Easily the best comicbook movie of the year so far',\n",
       " 'Awesome view into a different Marvel world. Action was spot on and the story telling kept you enthralled. Its message of nature vs nurture and finding ones purpose was great! A must watch! I will be seeing this movie again!',\n",
       " \"It is really hard to please me with films. I'll usually point out every single flaw. But Shang-Chi kept me engrossed for the entire length of the film - I genuinely couldn't look away. Amazing, emotional fight scenes, thrilling action scenes, and an awesome journey for a new hero.\",\n",
       " \"Best Marvel's solo film, visually stunning in camerarip itself that means in theatre! \\nBest music , editing , different screenplay, nice story , humor is expressed by Katy character, direction and story is fantastic, flashbacks are clear enough which is not in Black widow movie and finally more fantastic than expected had lots of fun, one sadness in my mind is not watched this movie in theatres but go to theatres worth of it , Thank you!\",\n",
       " \"One of the best Marvel movies till now. It's packed with cool action scenes and ties up well into the MCU. Has a good story, character played perfectly. And much better than Black Widow. I highly recommend you watch it ...\",\n",
       " '8.9/10 Shang Chi, absolute joy and entertainment from start to finish. Great fight scenes in the bus, scaffolding and moving vehicles. The last fight scenes were not to be missed too. Be sure to stay until the last credits to roll. You will find more footage there too. Well worth the watch, great characters, even the British actor and Morrison. #shangchi',\n",
       " \"This Movie was decent as a marvel fan after what came before this, titles like endgame infinity war its leaves your expectations very high they really dropped the bar on this movie and i can understand it because its a new character and we have to know the backstory etc. But the action didn't make up for the drag of the slow sentimental story telling, as well as non important flashbacks that i felt was not needed. Do not go see this movie late at night it will not keep you up…\",\n",
       " 'One of my favorite Marvel movies. Great martial arts/combat sequences, fantastic visuals, and I enjoyed the character development. It wasn\\'t perfect, but the next phase of MCU should be fine. My main issue is Awkwafina\\'s somewhat forced \"funny\" persona - felt like she tried too hard and was rigid in her delivery. She\\'s not on YouTube anymore.',\n",
       " \"THE ACTION AND FIGHT SCENE IS SUPERB! The bestie chemistry between Shang Chi and Katy was really good, they can be a good couple if ever. Overall is great, what a nice movie!! I didn't expect it to be that great!!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I hope it has a sequel!\",\n",
       " \"I just finished watching the movie oh my god this was amazing the pacing and action was perfect, also the humor was perfect and spot on, i defenilty recommend this movie, they perfectly introduced Shang-Chi into the marvel universe we know and love and they did it so good, and now for some reason i wanna learn karate or something like that but besides that i'm definitely getting some merch it was so good and the suits were cool too, so go watch Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings i promise its worth the wait 10/10\",\n",
       " 'Just loved it. Action was top class,VFX was undeniably the best of MCU till now ,and the emotions were up to the point and the humor was clicked at the right time. Visually it was very soothing. Unfortunately no 3d shows are available in India. But if you truly want to enjoy it,go to the theaters ASAP. Thank me later😉😉',\n",
       " 'Okay, so if you are deciding to watch this movie Shang - Chi and legend of 10 rings. Then I will really recommend this movie. Full action, adventure, suspense and much more. I rate it 5 stars because it is amazing. \\nMust watch and you will never reget that your whole life. Enjoy 😊',\n",
       " \"WOW WOW WOW I mean I knew since it's marvel that it's gunna be a good movie but Whoa! This movie is amazing! Everything is just amazing, the fights, the comedy, just saw it and I honestly want to go see it again! I'll admit I thought marvel hit it's high with avengers 3&4 but nope it hasn't! I really hope they keep making movies like this.\",\n",
       " \"I honestly wasn't expecting much from this film but having watched it, I loved it more than I thought I would.  They bring such a rich culture into this movie.  There is a whole different world that needs to be discovered.  Really glad to have an Asian superhero within Marvel.\",\n",
       " \"I didn't really care for the story of this movie. I almost never check my watch during a movie but this one had me glancing a few times wondering how much longer the movie was going to take. It just felt too drawn out and in all honesty the story itself wasn't that interesting to me. Also, the humor was VERY hit or miss. Some jokes had me laughing hard, while others really just had me rolling my eyes hoping the movie would end. \\nFinally, for a franchise that has been ramping up it's politically driven content, what really disappointed me is that this a movie specifically revolving around China's heritage, culture, and history, yet it tries to raise American social and political issues rather than to discuss Chinese political and social issues. \\n\\nPros:\\nFight sequences were nicely choreographed. Visual effects were pleasant to watch. The soundtrack, in some scenes, were absolute bangers. \\n\\nCons:\\nPacing of story all over the place. The actual story, to me, just wasn't interesting (or maybe the way it was executed just was weak). The acting was... Something to expect from a mid-tier movie at best. The incessant jokes. Somehow, it lacked originality: felt like any other kung-fu movie. \\n\\nOverall, it was fine, not a movie I will watch again by any means, but there are definitely worse marvel movies. I'd rate this a B-tier movie at best.\",\n",
       " 'Marvel is so amazing for making this movie. They are complete geniuses. The first ever Marvel kung fu movie and they completely nailed it. I love the acting I love Aquafina as Katie everything was just spot on and it made me a lot more excited for the films to come',\n",
       " 'I am not a huge fan of superhero type movies, because of how predictable they are. However, this movie stands out and I highly recommend it. The plot flows so nicely and it is not cliche like many other movies I’ve seen. 5 stars for sure. Lots of action too. And HUMOR!',\n",
       " 'Wow I was pleasantly surprised this was a great movie all the way around. However I could have simplified it to be about 5 minutes long. Here goes.\\n\\nDad calls kids on conference call,\\n\\nDad-\\n\\n\"Hey kids I needs a favor, can I barrow your green pendants for something important\"\\n\\nKids-\\n\\nSure Dad, do you want us to over night them or would you like us to stop by.\\n\\nDad-\\n\\nEither one, thanks.\\n\\nThe End',\n",
       " 'I like it very much. It presents Chinese culture from someone outside the mainland, which is amazing to me. I sincerely believe there are many ways to interpret Chinese culture and no one should be deemed as authentic while declaring others \"mis-interpreted\". I believe the movie did it in its own way. Great.',\n",
       " 'First the good. There are some nice fighting scenes. I liked Awkwafina. But there is so much more bad than good. For example. To go to an ancient hidden village, you need a car and drive at right angles. Why does Xu Wenwu continue to attack the wall, when he should see the demons coming out? Why does Xu Xialing take over the terrorist organisation of her hated father? Not the worst movie in the MCU, but close.',\n",
       " 'Not bad, but I felt like it was missing something. I think it could use a little less climactic monster fighting and more character moments, especially between the father and his two kids. The sister was just kind of there for most of the scenes and felt a bit wasted. I think this one could use a little more soul and little less action. That’s what makes Marvel great, the characters and the story, not the special effects and grandiose action sequences. Again, not bad, but  I’d skip it if you’re looking for a good stand alone movie. It really only worked for me because of the tie-ins with the MCU as a whole and the potential future stories.',\n",
       " \"Great CGI, Great plot, Amazing backstory and character development! only weakness was that some scenes felt rushed and I wish the transition between events would've been a bit smoother. Other than that fantastic movie! Must watch on the big screen, definitely going into my top 5.\",\n",
       " 'Not sure why so much hype. Watched and my feeling was \"meh..\". Just becasue disney have money they can take any risk now. The story is written from ATLA (Zuko Alone and his ark and Aang\\'s airbending), Snakeeye. This another overrated movie after GOTG Vol2, Captain Marvel and Dc\\'s Suicide Squad. Bunch of meaningless cameos and the comedy girl who thinks she is funny. Visuals are good in standard, somewhat ok BGM. Totally meaningless screenplay. Wait for it to be available for free on TV or Disney+.',\n",
       " 'I really enjoyed this movie.  VFX were spectacular.   Fight scenes were very cool.  Loved the Asian themed storyline and characters.  About time.  Awkwafina was (for me) questionable at the beginning but she offered the usual Marvel doses of humor.  All in all I thought it was great.',\n",
       " 'I saw this in Harkins Theater, and I liked it! I did already know that this movie was gonna be worth watching, and enjoying. For sure it was! The storyline was great. The action was good. But other than that, I give Shang-Chi a solid five stars across the board! One of the best Marvel movies made.',\n",
       " \"This movie does nothing to explain the ten rings of Iron Man legend. From that standpoint the movie was terrible.\\nAs a stand alone kung Fu movie: it still wasn't great. Nothing new in Choreography, and martial Arts movies still have a lot to learn about showing degrees of abilities. The only movie to get this right was Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.\\nI will say lots of Easter eggs and homage to other Marvel movies. If that's your jam run out and see this movie. If not wait for it to hit Disney Plus. I give this movie 2.5 stars out of five.\",\n",
       " 'This was an incredible movie, with amazing choreography and story. The characters are well developed, and the martial arts gives the fight scenes an extra glamor. The representation of Chinese culture and religion was done extremely well, tying in to the story beautifully. I highly recommend seeing it',\n",
       " \"1 star for their hardwork  of the character who make me do it for them not for the movie story . I thought, this movie will be the best of the marvel but they have only tried but not succed to apply perfectly.\\nThis movie actually fails in a good movie list becase the script was not great..It was something like a fun kinds of movie but not as a action type..They try to take the movie in a magical world but this also take them backward as I have watched it so, I'm saying these too..The introduction is confusing , at the middle the movie run so great but again at the ending  the movie is bad than the black widow...There's action scene better than black widow but the putting useless chracter at the end of the movie makes it too bad..100% you will see it as bad movie list of marvel after you watched the movie...Yeah, I'm DC fan..I'm proud to be it not like you marvel kids who only watches movie for the joke ...Time to rise in content not in box office\\n#Restorethesnyderverse for my DCEU #DC is better than marvel studio\",\n",
       " \"It was a really good movie. I really liked it very action packed and better than I thought it would be. I still think that Black Widow was better. This movie kind of reminded me of Frozen 2. With how his dad thought he heard his wife's voice. In Frozen 2 how Elsa heard the music. Still a really great movie but only gonna get 4 stars for me.\",\n",
       " 'This is the kinda film that beats the lockdown blues. Perfect film to watch on a big screen. Excellent gorgeous visuals with plenty of action (a bit too much though ).\\nHands down the best origin movie from marvel. The postcredits scene is good too.',\n",
       " 'Definitely worth seeing! Marvel sure has the formula to keep pushing out great movies even when it switches up the style like this one. It had it all, great story, non stop action, humor, and emotion. A must see for this year!!',\n",
       " 'I saw this movie on 9/2/21 and it is so different from any other Marvel movie. But it was just as good! The fighting scenes were amazing, the story is very well told and the end fight scene is awesome! Also. The mid-credit scene had me SO excited!',\n",
       " 'So with the terrible introduction of The Mandarin in Iron Man that was total BS… now this?!? Instead of straightening out the origin and the  bad asseness of The Mandarin…let’s jump to his son??? Doesn’t matter how awesome your special effects are or your fight choreography is…if your characters history has been completely altered by writers and directors who are continually trying to reinvent the wheel….you lose audiences!!! What is wrong with you Hollywood? Maybe you should stop being a puppet to the big red Winnie the Pooh followers! Back to basics and being ORIGINAL!',\n",
       " 'Just watched Shang-Chi Legend of the Ten Rings; nothing much to say except that the movie was phenomenal! Great action, humor, and characters/villains. Actors fitted the characters well. The plot was sophisticated but still simple and fresh. 10/10 would recommend, definitely go watch!',\n",
       " \"Loved that a good 40% of it was in Chinese to keep the movie's authenticity. The storyline I felt was a little typical, centering around the flaws of family and rebellion.I think Marvel nailed the interpretation of Asian representation and I liked the neat touches on tradition and culture. I would give this one a 7/10, purely because I am not a big fan of Marvel movies. (Interstellar is a 10/10 for reference)\",\n",
       " \"This was a good watch. Nothing spectacular... It won't be all that memorable but I'm not pissed that I left my house to watch this. Most of the cast executed their parts well too. Not to hate but Awkwafina's character wasn't necessary and her arc was very VERY predictable.Finally, the mid credit scene was a fun part.\",\n",
       " 'Amazing movie! Fighting scenes were amazing with such great movements and beautiful actions, there were funny parts which made the movie not so tense and added a little bit of humor! We had culture in this movie, and different languages! I was not disappointed if u did not like this movie then do better.',\n",
       " 'This was a great movie, very well done. I’m a fan of classic Asian cinema, and I completely agree with all the other great reviews in terms of the acting, fighting sequences, cgi and other effects.

Simu Liu and the entire cast did a phenomenal job playing their characters (and A+ for the wonderful representation)!! Everything in this movie was 10/10, from the plot to the visuals to the casting, and so on! I DEFINITELY recommend it!',\n",
       " 'The begging was hilarious hands down and I loved the chemistry and representation. I wish they would have made it PG-14 instead of PG-13 because so it could be more realistic but at least their were more magic but the reason why I gave it three stars it I had a little higher expectations. But I don’t regret watching every single second!!',\n",
       " 'Coming from an Asian American who has watched Chinese and American movies for 40+ years, this is seriously one of the best! It captured feels of American films, retro Hong Kong film, Chinese Kung-fu, Chinese-drama, plus Marvel magic! Loved it. A classic for ages to come!',\n",
       " \"Nothing new here. Katy is quite honest. The bus scene is so boring it doesn't make any sense compared to Nobody. It's soo far better than this. It's not the Asian black panther. As much fun as the fights are they can't match the gasp or wince inducing wallop of Jackie Chan fight scenes, in which you know the star and stunt performers really are leaping around a moving vehicle or the side of a building. There are moments where characters are just chatting in a field and the field clearly isn't real.\",\n",
       " 'Funny movie.  Good characters.  Good end of movie teasers that leave you wanting more info in marvel fashion. The story is great and has a decidedly strong Asian influence that will play well with the mcu.  The final battle scene is dynamic and frankly beautiful.',\n",

TONY LEUNG PLAYED THE VILLIAN WELL. FALA CHAN ROLE WAS THE EMOTIONAL PART OF THE MOVIE. HER ROLE WAS NICE FOR EMOTIONAL TOUCH. MICHELLE YEOH PLAYED HER PART WELL. MENG' ER ZHANG PLAYED THE ROLE OF XIALING WELL. SHE WAS THE MOST UNPREDICTABLE CHARACTER OF THE MOVIE. THE ACTION, COMEDY, CGI, USE OF MARTIAL ARTS, MYSTICAL ANIMALS, A WHOLE NEW MAGICAL PLACE MADE THE MOVIE COMPLETE.

At the end though, I was left wanting in a way I have not been by an MCU film. Maybe I shouldn't have watched all those shorts on YouTube, I don't know. I was expecting Dr. Strange or best case Black Panther. What I got was a film that tried too hard to do too much. The plot was derivative and the story was mushy. The editors made suspect choices, laughs were in the wrong spots and it dragged in places. Nobody bats a thousand, Feige has come close. I'm probably the victim of my own expectations here. I'm not sure I'll even go to Eternals.  I'm a sucker though, I'll probably pay up. It's may be my last if I walk out wishing I hadn't spent the money.\",\n",

None of the characters were developed particularly well, and none of Them were very like able. Akwafinas character, Katy, was one of the most dislikable characters I have ever watched. She was supposed to be the comedic relief, yet her jokes were always corny and did not deliver well. She was not funny in any way. She really made this movie hard to watch, for she is brought along as an important character for the entirety of the movie. This movie is not worth the watch in theaters.',\n",

For people that say that this is \"groundbreaking\", \"best MCU movie of all time\", \"featured the first Asian Superhero\", you\\'re just being disingenuous. This movie was okay at most. Probably has the best action scenes in an MCU film but not even close to what Asian made films have (ie. Raid: Redemption, Ong Bak, Tom Yum Goong) and the story feels like it was 2-3 movies mashed into one. \\n\\nAlso Bruce Lee was the first Asian Superhero (Kato).

At quite a few places in movies, the CGI felt was not on point as there is way too much CGI and I could certainly tell when they were in front of a green screen.

I watch the movie after seeing the review.. But it is just a worst movie... I just waste my time. Please Don't waste your time. And the movie is not worth more than 2 star.

The initial part of the movie, leading up to the bus fight was quite promising but subsequently was a waste of time. Definitely not worth going to the cinema to watch. There were some hilarious scenes here and there but the lack of storyline and loopholes just spoils the whole movie experience. From stealing the jade pendant to installing it on the lion eyes just lack some storyline of how all this came about.',\n",
